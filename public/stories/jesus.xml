      <text>Of these Messengers, We have preferred some above others. To some Allah spoke; and some He raised in rank. We gave (Prophet) Jesus, the son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Spirit of Purity (Gabriel). Had Allah willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear verses came to them. But they differed among themselves; some believed, and others disbelieved. Yet had Allah willed, they would not have fought against one another. Allah does whatever He will.</text>

      <text>O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion, and do not say about God except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, is the Messenger of God, and His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Refrain—it is better for you. God is only one God. Glory be to Him—that He should have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, and God is a sufficient Protector.</text>

I also saw Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire and Ad-Dajjal amongst the signs which Allah showed me.&quot; (The Prophet then recited the Holy Verse): &quot;So be not you in doubt of meeting him&apos; when you met Moses during the night of Mi&apos;raj over the heavens&quot; (32.23)
Narrated Anas and Abu Bakra: &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;The angels will guard Medina from Ad-Dajjal (who will not be able to enter the city of Medina).&quot;</text>

While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), &apos;Shall I answer her or keep on praying?&quot; (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, &quot;O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.&quot; So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said, &apos;O child! Who is your father?&apos; The child replied, &apos;The shepherd.&apos; (After hearing this) the people said, &apos;We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,&apos; but he said, &apos;No, of nothing but mud.&apos;(The third was the hero of the following story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, &apos;O Allah ! Make my child like him.&apos; On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, &apos;O Allah! Do not make me like him.&apos; The child then started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, &quot;As if I were now looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.&quot;) After a while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child&apos;s mother) said, &apos;O Allah! Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, &apos;O Allah!

Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&quot; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &quot;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&quot; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &quot;The animal&apos;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&apos;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.
When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has Muhammad been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &apos;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven.

Gabriel said (to me), &apos;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&apos; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&apos;
The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked. &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&apos; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&apos; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &apos;What makes you weep?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked,&apos; Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &apos;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &apos;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&apos; He replied,&apos; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos;
Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &apos;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&apos; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &apos;What have you been ordered to do?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&apos; burden.&apos; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.
When I came back to Moses, he said, &apos;What have you been ordered?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&apos; He said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&apos;s burden.&apos; I said, &apos;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&apos;s Order.&apos; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &apos;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:
During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&quot; They replied, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&quot; They replied, &quot;No.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, &quot;Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.&quot; Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, &apos;Who do you use to worship?&apos; They will say, &apos;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?&apos; They will say, &apos;O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.&apos; They will be directed and addressed thus, &apos;Will you drink,&apos; whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, &apos;Who do you use to worship?&apos; They will say, &apos;We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,&apos; Then it will be said to them, &apos;What do you want?&apos; They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, &apos;What are you waiting for?&apos; Every nation have followed what they used to worship.&apos; They will reply, &apos;We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will say twice or thrice, &apos;We do not worship any besides Allah.&apos; &quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
Some (cooked) meat was brought to Allah Apostle and the meat of a forearm was presented to him as he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, &quot;I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Allah will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people will say, &apos;Don&apos;t you see to what state you have reached? Won&apos;t you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord&apos; Some people will say to some others, &apos;Go to Adam.&apos; So they will go to Adam and say to him. &apos;You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are? Don&apos;t you see what condition we have reached?&apos; Adam will say, &apos;Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.&apos; So they will go to Noah and say (to him), &apos;O Noah! You are the first (of Allah&apos;s Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Allah has named you a thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; He will say.&apos; Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.&apos; They will go to Abraham and say, &apos;O Abraham! You are Allah&apos;s Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; He will say to them, &apos;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter.

Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.&apos; So they will go to Jesus and say, &apos;O Jesus!

Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; Jesus will say. &apos;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, &apos;Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.&apos; So they will come to me and say, &apos;O Muhammad ! You are Allah&apos;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Then I will go beneath Allah&apos;s Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.&apos; So I will raise my head and Say, &apos;My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord&apos;. It will be said, &apos;O Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people.&quot; The Prophet further said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham).&quot;</text>

He will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and will remember his sin and say, &apos;Go to Moses to whom Allah spoke directly.&apos; They will go to Moses and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and will remember his sin and say, &apos;Go to Jesus.&apos; They will go to him, and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad as Allah has forgiven his past and future sins.&apos; They will come to me and I will ask my Lord&apos;s permission, and when I see Him, I will fall down in prostration to Him, and He will leave me in that state as long as (He) Allah will, and then I will be addressed. &apos;Raise up your head (O Muhammad)! Ask, and your request will be granted, and say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&apos; Then I will raise my head, and I will glorify and praise my Lord with a saying(i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede, Allah will fix a limit for me (i.e., certain type of people for whom I may intercede), and I will take them out of the (Hell) Fire and let them enter Paradise. Then I will come back (to Allah) and fall in prostration, and will do the same for the third and fourth times till no-one remains in the (Hell) Fire except those whom the Qur&apos;an has imprisoned therein.&quot; (The sub-narrator, Qatada used to say at that point, &quot;...those upon whom eternity (in Hell) has been imposed.&quot;) (See Hadith No. 3, Vol 6).</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas:
I used to teach (the Qur&apos;an to) some people of the Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &apos;Abdur Rahman bin &apos;Auf. While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &apos;Umar&apos;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, &quot;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of the Believers (&apos;Umar), saying, &apos;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about so-and-so who says, &apos;If &apos;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&apos; &apos;Umar became angry and then said, &apos;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&quot;
&apos;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;I said, &apos;O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophet&apos;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&apos; On that, &apos;Umar said, &apos;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver before the people in Medina.&quot;
Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa&apos;id bin Zaid bin &apos;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a short while &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to Said bin Zaid bin &apos;Amr bin Nufail &quot;Today &apos;Umar will say such a thing as he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph.&quot; Said denied my statement with astonishment and said, &quot;What thing do you expect &apos;Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?&quot;
In the meantime, &apos;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &apos;Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;Now then, I am going to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&apos;s Apostle did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him.
I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, &apos;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&apos;s Book,&apos; and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&apos;s Book: &apos;O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.&apos; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah&apos;s Slave and His Apostles.&apos; (O people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, &apos;By Allah, if &apos;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.&apos; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed.
And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. &apos;Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, &apos;Let&apos;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, &apos;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you going?&apos; We replied, &apos;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; They said to us, &apos;You shouldn&apos;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&apos; I said, &apos;By Allah, we will go to them.&apos; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &apos;Who is that man?&apos; They said, &apos;He is Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada.&apos; I asked, &apos;What is wrong with him?&apos; They said, &apos;He is sick.&apos; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&apos;s speaker said, &apos;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&apos; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &apos;To proceed, we are Allah&apos;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&apos;
When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &apos;Wait a while.&apos; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, &apos;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&apos;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&apos;t feel at present.&apos;
And then one of the Ansar said, &apos;I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you.&apos;
Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &apos;O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.&apos; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa&apos;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the Ansar said, &apos;You have killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; I replied, &apos;Allah has killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; Umar added, &quot;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Dhar:
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered: &apos;Gabriel.&apos; He asked, &apos;Is there anyone with you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&apos; He asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Yes.&apos; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; He replied, &apos;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&apos;
Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &quot;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &quot;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; The Prophet asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Idris.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;I passed by Moses and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Moses.&apos; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; I asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Jesus.
Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&quot; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &quot;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &apos;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&apos; I replied, &apos;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &apos;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &apos;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &apos;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&apos; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &apos;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&apos; Then Gabriel took me till we &apos;&apos; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&quot;</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;Allah will gather the believers on the Day of Resurrection in the same way (as they are gathered in this life), and they will say, &apos;Let us ask someone to intercede for us with our Lord that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Then they will go to Adam and say, &apos;O Adam! Don&apos;t you see the people (people&apos;s condition)? Allah created you with His Own Hands and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all the things. Please intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he had committed, and add, &quot;But you d better go to Noah as he was the first Apostle sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&apos; They will go to Noah who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention the mistake which he made, and add, &apos;But you&apos;d better go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&apos;
They will go to Abraham who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &apos;But you&apos;d better go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and to whom He spoke directly&apos; They will go to Moses who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &apos;You&apos;d better go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s slave and His Apostle and His Word (Be: And it was) and a soul created by Him.&apos; They will go to Jesus who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking, but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad whose sins of the past and the future had been forgiven (by Allah).&apos; So they will come to me and I will ask the permission of my Lord, and I will be permitted (to present myself) before Him. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then raise my head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit whom I will admit into Paradise.
I will come back again, and when I see my Lord (again), I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise, I will return again, and when I see my Lord, I will fall down (in prostration) and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede.

None remains in Hell (Fire) but those whom Qur&apos;an has imprisoned therein and for whom eternity in Hell (Fire) has become inevitable.&apos; &quot;
The Prophet added, &quot;There will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos;La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos; La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid Al-Laithi:
On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, &apos;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that thing),&apos; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will (deny Him and) say, &apos;We will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&apos; So Allah will come to them in His appearance which they know, and will say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will say, &apos;You are our Lord,&apos; so they will follow Him.
Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&apos; I and my followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &apos;O Allah, save! Save!&apos; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&apos;dan? &quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan, but none knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the mud of the torrent.
Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &apos;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&apos; So he will invoke Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &apos;If I grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&apos; He will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand.
So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, &apos;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&apos; Allah will say to him, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are!&apos; He will say, &apos;O my lord,&apos; and will keep on invoking Allah till He says to him, &apos;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&apos;
Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been given?&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are! &apos;
The man will say, &apos;O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of Your creation,&apos; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him, &apos;Enter Paradise,&apos; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &apos;Wish for anything.&apos; So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &apos;(Wish for) so-and-so.&apos; When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &apos;This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well.&quot;
&apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid added: Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that Allah had said, &quot;That is for you and its equal as well,&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri said, &quot;And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!&quot; Abu Huraira said, &quot;I do not remember, except his saying, &apos;That is for you and its equal as well.&apos;&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri then said, &quot;I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, &apos;That is for you, and ten times as much.&apos; &apos; Abu Huraira then added, &quot;That man will be the last person of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise.&quot;
Narrated Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri:
We said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?&quot; We said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&quot; The Prophet then said, &quot;Somebody will then announce, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&apos; So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &quot;What did you use to worship?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; Then it will be said to them &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &apos;What did you use to worship?&apos;
They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?&apos; They will say, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &apos;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&apos; They will say, &apos;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&apos; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&apos; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &apos;I am your Lord,&apos; and they will say, &apos;You are not our Lord.&apos; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &apos;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&apos; They will say. &apos;The Shin,&apos; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&quot; We, the companions of the Prophet said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&apos;
He said, &quot;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&apos;dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe.
They will say, &apos;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.&apos; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&apos; They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse:--
&apos;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&apos; (4.40) The Prophet added, &quot;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, &apos;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life.
They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &apos;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&apos; Then it will be said to them, &apos;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&apos;&quot;
Narrated Anas:
The Prophet said, &quot;The believers will be kept (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say, &quot;Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from our place.
Then they will go to Adam and say, &apos;You are Adam, the father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours? Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; He will mention his mistakes he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He will add, &apos;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&apos; The people will go to Noah who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking&apos; He will mention his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&apos; He will say (to them), &apos;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&apos; They will go to Abraham who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). &apos;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought near Him, for conversation.&apos;
They will go to Moses who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to them), &apos;Go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by Allah.&apos; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&apos;s permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&apos; Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me. Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them out and make them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the Prophet said, &quot;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I will be permitted.
When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&apos; &quot; The Prophet added, &quot;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &apos;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter.
When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him, and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;Raise your head, O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&apos; So I will raise my head and praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &quot;So I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for eternal life in the fire).&quot; The narrator then recited the Verse:-- &quot;It may be that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&apos; (17.79) The narrator added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet.</text>

      <text>Narrated Ma&apos;bad bin Hilal Al&apos;Anzi:
We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, &quot;Do not ask him about anything else first but the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; He said, &quot;O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; Anas then said, &quot;Muhammad talked to us saying, &apos;On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, &apos;Please intercede for us with your Lord.&apos; He will say, &apos;I am not fit for that but you&apos;d better go to Abraham as he is the Khalil of the Beneficent.&apos; They will go to Abraham and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.&apos; So they will go to Moses and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was) they will go to Jesus and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad.&apos;
They would come to me and I would say, &apos;I am for that.&apos; Then I will ask for my Lord&apos;s permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; And then it will be said, &apos;Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; It will be said, &apos;Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, &apos;O, Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers!&apos; Then He will say, &apos;Go and take out (all those) in whose hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the Fire.&apos; I will go and do so.&quot;&apos;
When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, &quot;Let&apos;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&quot; So we went to him and we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, &quot;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I have never heard.&quot; He said, &quot;What is that?&quot; Then we told him of the Hadith and said, &quot;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&quot; He said, &quot;What then?&quot; We said, &quot;He did not add anything to that.&quot; He said, Anas related the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&apos;t know whether he forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&quot; We said, &quot;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&quot; He smiled and said, &quot;Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it.
Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet added, &apos;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as he &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted .&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, &apos;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&apos; Then Allah will say, &apos;By my Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: &apos;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&apos; &apos;&apos;</text>

      <text>Some of the Jews have said that Ezra is the son of God and Christians have said the same of Jesus. This is only what they say and it is similar to what the unbelievers who lived before them had said. May God destroy them wherever they exist!</text>
