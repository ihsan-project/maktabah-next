After finishing from the prayer, he addressed the people present there saying, &quot;Be patient! Don&apos;t go away. Have the glad tiding.

          <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
(the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&apos;s Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &quot;I do not know how to read.
The Prophet added, &quot;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, &apos;I do not know how to read.&apos; Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, &apos;I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?&apos; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, &apos;Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.&quot; (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, &quot;Cover me! Cover me!&quot; They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, &quot;I fear that something may happen to me.&quot; Khadija replied, &quot;Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.&quot;
Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, &quot;Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!&quot; Waraqa asked, &quot;O my nephew! What have you seen?&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle asked, &quot;Will they drive me out?&quot; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, &quot;Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.
Narrated Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet &quot;While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira&apos; sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, &apos;Wrap me (in blankets).&apos; And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran):
&apos;O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!&apos; Arise and warn (the people against Allah&apos;s Punishment),... up to &apos;and desert the idols.&apos; (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly.&quot;</text>

The Prophet came to Medina and saw the Jews fasting on the day of Ashura. He asked them about that.

          <text>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&apos;b:
The Prophet said, &quot;Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, &quot;Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &quot;I am the most learned.&quot; Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him &quot;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.&quot; Moses said, &quot;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&quot; Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha&apos; bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: &quot;Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey.&quot; Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, &quot;Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish.&quot; Moses remarked, &quot;That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, &quot;How do people greet each other in your land?&quot; Moses said, &quot;I am Moses.&quot; He asked, &quot;The Moses of Bani Israel?&quot; Moses replied in the affirmative and added, &quot;May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: &quot;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah&apos;s knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.&quot; Al-Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, &quot;These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Call me not to account for what I forgot.&quot; The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy&apos;s head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, &quot;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none.&quot; Al-Kha,dir replied, &quot;Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?&quot; Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, &quot;If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;This is the parting between you and me.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. &quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
Two persons, a Muslim and a Jew, quarrelled. The Muslim said, &quot;By Him Who gave Muhammad superiority over all the people! The Jew said, &quot;By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the people!&quot; At that the Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew on the face. The Jew went to the Prophet and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet sent for the Muslim and asked him about it. The Muslim informed him of the event. The Prophet said, &quot;Do not give me superiority over Moses, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be one of them, but I will. be the first to gain consciousness, and will see Moses standing and holding the side of the Throne (of Allah). I will not know whether (Moses) has also fallen unconscious and got up before me, or Allah has exempted him from that stroke.&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated &apos;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair:
When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, &quot;O my son! Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?&quot; Az-Zubair added, &quot;O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts.&quot; Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, &apos;Abdullah&apos;s sons. He said, &quot;One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.&quot; (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, &quot;Some of the sons of &apos;Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and &apos;Abbas. &apos;Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that time.&quot; (The narrator &apos;Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, &quot;If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you.&quot; By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, &quot;O father! Who is your Master?&quot; He replied, &quot;Allah (is my Master).&quot; By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, &quot;Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .&quot; and Allah would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az Zubair would say, &quot;No, (i won&apos;t keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.&quot; Az-Zubair was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, &apos;Umar, and &apos;Uthman. (&apos;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met Abdullah bin Zubair and asked, &quot;O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?&quot; &apos;Abdullah kept it as a secret and said, &quot;One hundred thousand,&quot; Hakim said, &quot;By Allah! I don&apos;t think your property will cover it.&quot; On that &apos;Abdullah said to him, &quot;What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?&quot; Hakim said, &quot;I don&apos;t think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.&quot; Az-Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. &apos;Abdullah sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, &quot;Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.&quot; There came to him &apos;Abdullah bin Ja&apos;far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to &apos;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, &quot;If you wish I will forgive you the debt.&quot; &apos;Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said, &quot;No.&quot; Then Ibn Ja&apos;far said, &quot;If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt.&quot; Ibn Az-Zubair said, &quot;No.&quot; &apos;Abdullah bin Ja&apos;far said, &quot;Give me a piece of the land.&quot; &apos;Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to him), &quot;Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.&quot; So, &apos;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu&apos;awlya while &apos;Amr bin &apos;Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam&apos;a were sitting with him. Mu&apos;awiya asked, &quot;At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?&quot; He said, &quot;One hundred thousand for each share,&quot; Muawiya asked, &quot;How many shares have been left?&quot; &apos;Abdullah replied, &quot;Four and a half shares.&quot; Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, &quot;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&quot; &apos;Amr bin &apos;Uthman said, &quot;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&quot; Ibn Zam&apos;a said, &quot;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&quot; Muawiya said, &quot;How much is left now?&quot; &apos;Abdullah replied, &quot;One share and a half.&quot; Muawiya said, &quot;I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand.&quot; &apos;Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair&apos;s sons said to him, &quot;Distribute our inheritance among us.&quot; He said, &quot;No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, &apos;Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.&quot; So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.</text>

Once we were in the house of Abu Musa who presented a meal containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Allah with red complexion as if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa invited him to share the meal but he (apologised) saying. &quot;I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat chickens.&quot; Abu Musa said, &quot;Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e. how to cancel one&apos;s oat ). I went to the Prophet in the company of a group of Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, &apos;By Allah, I will not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.&apos; Then some camels as booty were brought to Allah&apos;s Apostle and he asked for us saying. &apos;Where are the group of Al-Ash&apos;ariyun?&apos; Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with white humps. When we set out we said, &apos;What have we done? We will never be blessed (with what we have been given).&apos; So, we returned to the Prophet and said, &apos;We asked you to provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He replied. &apos;I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Allah has provided you with it, and by Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is better, and give expiation for my oath.&quot;</text>

We got the news of the migration of the Prophet while we were in Yemen, so we set out migrating to him. We were, I and my two brothers, I being the youngest, and one of my brothers was Abu Burda and the other was Abu Ruhm. We were over fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) men from our people. We got on board a ship which took us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja&apos;far bin Abu Talib and his companions with An-Najaishi.

He gave us a share from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share to any person who had not participated in Khaibar&apos;s conquest except the people of our ship, besides Ja&apos;far and his companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship).</text>

          <text>Narrated Malik bin Sasaa:
The Prophet said, &quot;While I was at the House in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel. When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, &apos;Open the gate.&apos; The gatekeeper asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; He said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; The gate-keeper,&apos; Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; The gate-keeper said, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&apos; Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, &apos;You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was said, &apos;Who is with you?&apos; He said, &apos;Muhammad&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been sent for?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; It was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&quot; Then I met Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, &apos;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is with you? Gabriel said, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been sent for?&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; said Gabriel. &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&apos; (The Prophet added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, &apos;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet!&apos; Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met and greeted Aaron who said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet&quot;. Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and. a Prophet.&apos; When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, &apos;O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.&apos; Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Abraham who said, &apos;You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.&apos; Then I was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma&apos;mur (i.e. Allah&apos;s House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).&apos; Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, &apos;The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos; Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, &apos;What have you done?&apos; I said, &apos;Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.&apos; He said, &apos;I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.&apos; I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again, he said, &apos;What have you done?&apos; I said, &apos;Allah has made it five only.&apos; He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah&apos;s Final Order)&apos;&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle was addressed by Allah, &quot;I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.&quot;</text>

He said, &apos;I.&apos; Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him, &apos;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you.&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&apos; Allah said, &apos;Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&apos; Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &apos;bin Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &apos;Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&apos; Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, &apos;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?.&apos; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, &apos;That was what we were seeking after.&apos; So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, &apos;How do people greet each other in your land?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; The man asked, &apos;Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&apos; He said, &apos;O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know.&apos; Moses asked, &apos;May I follow you?&apos; He said, &apos;But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand?&apos; (Moses said, &apos;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.&apos;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &apos;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah&apos;s Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.&apos; Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, &apos;What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing.&apos; Al-Khadir replied, &apos;Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me?&apos; Moses replied, &apos;Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault.&apos; So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys.
Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, &quot;Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.&quot; Al-Khadir said, &quot;Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?&apos; Moses said &quot;If I ask you about anything after this, don&apos;t accompany me. You have received an excuse from me.&apos; Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, &quot;These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.&quot; Al-Khadir said, &quot;This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, &quot;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.&quot;)</text>

          <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the children of Israel hurt him by saying, &apos;He covers his body in this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&apos; Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &apos;O stone! Give me my garment!&apos; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:-- &quot;O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&apos;s Sight.&quot; (33.69)</text>

The Prophet kept silent for a short while and then said, &quot;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&quot; Behold! It was &apos;Uthman bin &apos;Affan. &apos;Asim, in another narration, said that the Prophet was sitting in a place where there was water, and he was uncovering both his knees or his knee, and when &apos;Uthman entered, he covered them (or it).</text>

          <text>Narrated Abbas bin Malik:
Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&apos;s Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, &quot;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&quot; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, &quot;What does he mean?&quot; He said, &quot;It means from his throat to his pubic area,&quot; or said, &quot;From the top of the chest.&quot; The Prophet further said, &quot;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&quot; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &quot;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&quot; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &quot;The animal&apos;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&apos;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.
When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has Muhammad been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &apos;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened.
When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and &apos;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&apos; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&apos;
The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked. &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&apos; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&apos; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &apos;What makes you weep?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked,&apos; Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &apos;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &apos;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&apos; He replied,&apos; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos;
Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &apos;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&apos; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &apos;What have you been ordered to do?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&apos; burden.&apos; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.
When I came back to Moses, he said, &apos;What have you been ordered?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&apos; He said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&apos;s burden.&apos; I said, &apos;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&apos;s Order.&apos; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &apos;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Abu Musa:
The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met Ja&apos;far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the people of the ship, &quot;We have migrated before you.&quot; Asma&apos; bint &apos;Umais who was one of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. &apos;Umar came to Hafsa while Asma&apos; bint &apos;Umais was with her. &apos;Umar, on seeing Asma,&apos; said, &quot;Who is this?&quot; She said, &quot;Asma&apos; bint &apos;Umais,&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the sea-faring lady?&quot; Asma&apos; replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;We have migrated before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah&apos;s Apostle &quot; On that Asma&apos; became angry and said, &quot;No, by Allah, while you were with Allah&apos;s Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake of Allah&apos;s Apostle . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I inform Allah&apos;s Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add something to it.&quot; So when the Prophet came, she said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Prophet &apos;Umar has said so-and-so.&quot; He said (to Asma&apos;), &quot;What did you say to him?&quot; Asma&apos;s aid, &quot;I told him so-and-so.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;He (i.e. &apos;Umar) has not got more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations.&quot; Asma&apos; later on said, &quot;I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them.&quot;
Narrated Abu Burda: Asma&apos; said, &quot;I saw Abu Musa requesting me to repeat this narration again and again.&quot;
Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur&apos;an, when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their voices when they are reciting the Qur&apos;an at night although I have not seen their houses when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Hakim who, on meeting the cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to wait for them.&apos; &quot;</text>

When the Prophet had finished from the battle of Hunain, he sent Abu Amir at the head of an army to Autas He (i.e. Abu Amir) met Duraid bin As Summa and Duraid was killed and Allah defeated his companions. The Prophet sent me with Abu &apos;Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, &quot;O Uncle! Who shot you?&quot; He pointed me out (his killer) saying, &quot;That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow).&quot; So I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and started saying to him, &quot;Won&apos;t you be ashamed? Won&apos;t you stop?&quot; So that person stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu &apos;Amir. &quot;Allah has killed your killer.&quot; He said, &quot;Take out this arrow&quot; So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, &quot;O son of my brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah&apos;s Forgiveness for me.&quot; Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir&apos;s news and how he had said &quot;Tell him to ask for Allah&apos;s Forgiveness for me.&quot; The Prophet asked for water, performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Forgive &apos;Ubaid, Abu Amir.&quot; At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet&apos;s armpits. The Prophet then said, &quot;O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many of Your human creatures.&quot; I said, &quot;Will you ask Allah&apos;s Forgiveness for me?&quot; (On that) the Prophet said, &quot;O Allah, forgive the sins of &apos;Abdullah bin Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; Abu Burda said, &quot;One of the prayers was for Abu &apos;Amir and the other was for Abu Musa (i.e. &apos;Abdullah bin Qais).&quot;</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen. He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The Prophet said (to them), &quot;Facilitate things for the people and do not make things difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once Mu&apos;adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his companion Abu Musa. Mu&apos;adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his hands behind his neck. Mu&apos;adh said to Abu Musa, &quot;O &apos;Abdullah bin Qais! What is this?&quot; Abu Musa replied. &quot;This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam.&quot; Mu&apos;adh said, &quot;I will not dismount till he is killed.&quot; Abu Musa replied, &quot;He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.&quot; Mu&apos;adh said, &quot;I will not dismount till he is killed.&quot; So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed, and he was killed. Then Mu&apos;adh dismounted and said, &quot;O Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do you recite the Qur&apos;an ?&quot; Abu Musa said, &quot;I recite the Qur&apos;an regularly at intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu&apos;adh?&quot; Mu&apos;adh said, &quot;I sleep in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me. So I seek Allah&apos;s Reward for both my sleep as well as my prayer (at night).&quot;</text>

(18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.
The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant &apos;Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&apos; (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,&apos; &apos;Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.&apos; (18.63)
There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, &apos;That is what we have been seeking&apos;. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. &apos;Is there such a greeting in your land?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; He said, &apos;Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught.
Al-Khadir said, &apos;You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah&apos;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah&apos;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.&apos; (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. &apos;If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&apos; (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.&apos; These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.&apos; (18.71)
Al-Khadir said, &apos;Didn&apos;t I say that you can have no patience with me ?&apos; (18.72) Moses said, &apos;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)&quot; (18.73)
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &apos;My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah&apos;s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.&apos; Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, &apos;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.&apos; (18.74) He said, &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you that you can have no patience with me?&apos; (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, &apos;If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.&apos; (18.76)
Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, &apos;These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, &apos;This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.&apos; (18.78-82)
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their story.&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Ibn Juraij:
Ya&apos;la bin Muslim and &apos;Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair.
Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &apos;Abbas, Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;Ask me (any question)&quot; I said, &quot;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&apos;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&quot; As for &apos;Amr, he said to me, &quot;Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&quot; But Ya&apos;la said to me, &quot;Ibn &apos;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&apos;b said, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Once Moses, Allah&apos;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&apos; Moses replied, &apos;No.&apos; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &apos;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord! Where is he?&apos; Allah said, &apos;At the junction of the two seas.&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&apos; &quot; &apos;Amr said to me, Allah said, &quot;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&quot; Ya&apos;la said to me, &quot;Allah said (to Moses), &apos;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&apos; &quot; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &quot;I don&apos;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&quot; He said (to Moses).&quot; You have not demanded too much.&quot; And that is as mentioned by Allah:
&apos;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant .... &apos; (18.60) Yusha&apos; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &quot;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &quot;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &apos;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &quot;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&quot; Moses said &quot;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&quot; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &apos;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &apos;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &quot;What do you want?&apos; Moses said, &apos; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&apos; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &apos;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&apos;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&apos; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &apos;The pious slave of Allah.&apos; (We said to Said &quot;Was that Khadir?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot;) The boat men said, &apos;We will not get him on board with fare.&apos; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &apos;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &quot;Moses said so protestingly.&quot;) Al-Khadir said, didn&apos;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&apos; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &apos;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&apos; (18.73)
(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&apos;la- said: Said said &apos;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &apos;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&apos; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &apos;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&apos;la said, &apos;I think Said said, &apos;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &apos;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &apos;Wages that we might had eaten.&apos; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&quot; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &apos;Abbas recited: &apos;In front of them (was) a king.&apos;
It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &apos;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &apos;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&apos; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &apos;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&apos; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&apos; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&apos;? (18.74). &apos;Near to mercy&quot; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&apos;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &apos;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</text>

          <text>Narrated Said bin Jubair:
I said to Ibn &apos;Abbas, &quot;Nauf-al-Bakali &quot; claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;Allah&apos;s enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka&apos;b narrated to us that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, &apos;Who is the most learned person among the people?&apos; Moses replied, &apos;I (am the most learned).&apos; Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:-- &apos;Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.&apos;
Moses said, &apos;O my Lord ! How can meet him?&apos; Allah said, &apos;Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha&apos; bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than &apos;Amr said) &apos;At the rock there was a water spring called &apos;Al-Hayat&apos; and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, &apos;Bring our early meal&apos; (18.62).
The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, &apos;Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...&apos; (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, &apos;Is there any such greeting in your land?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; The man said, &apos;Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes,&apos; and added, &apos;may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?&apos; (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, &apos;O Moses! You have something of Allah&apos;s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah&apos;s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.&apos; Moses said, &apos;But I will follow you.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&apos; (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. &apos;My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation&apos;s knowledge compared to Allah&apos;s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow&apos;s beak.&apos;
Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir&apos;s action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, &apos;These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have...&apos; (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, &apos;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! &apos; (18.74) He said, &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.&apos; (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, &apos;When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.&apos;...(18.78)
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their story.&apos; Ibn &apos;Abbas used to recite:-- &apos;And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) ...and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. &quot;</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &apos;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&apos; So they will go to Adam and say, &apos;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&apos; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &apos;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&apos; They will go to him and Noah will say,
&apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &apos;Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&apos; They will go to him and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&apos; So they will go to him and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &apos;Go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&apos;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&apos; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&apos;s Permission and I will be given permission.

          <text>Narrated Aisha:
(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah&apos;s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah&apos;s Apostle replied, &quot;I do not know how to read.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &apos;I do not know how to read.&apos; Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. &apos;I do not know how to read.&apos; Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, &apos;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.&quot; (96.1-5).
Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, &quot;Cover me!&quot; They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, &quot;O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me.&quot; Then he told her the story. Khadija said, &quot;Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities.&quot; Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija&apos;s paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), &quot;O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say.&quot; Waraqa said, &quot;O my nephew! What have you seen?&quot; The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young.&quot; He added some other statement. Allah&apos;s Apostle asked, &quot;Will these people drive me out?&quot; Waraqa said, &quot;Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly.&quot; But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah&apos;s Apostle was very much grieved.
Narrated Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah: While Allah&apos;s Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. &quot;Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.&apos; He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!&quot; So they covered him and then Allah revealed:
&apos;O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.&apos; (74.1-5)
Abu Salama said, &quot;(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship.&quot; After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.</text>

We were in the company of Abu Musa Al-Ash&apos;ari and there were friendly relations between us and this tribe of Jarm. Abu Musa was presented with a dish containing chicken. Among the people there was sitting a red-faced man who did not come near the food. Abu Musa said (to him), &quot;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&apos;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&quot; He said, &quot;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &apos; Abu Musa said, &quot;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&apos;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &apos;I have nothing to mount you on&apos; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&apos;s Apostle and he asked twice, &apos;Where are Al-Ash&apos;ariyin?&quot; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&apos;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&quot; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&apos; He said, &apos;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&apos; &quot;</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;On every Muslim there is enjoined (a compulsory) Sadaqa (alms).&quot; They (the people) said, &quot;If one has nothing?&apos; He said, &quot;He should work with his hands so that he may benefit himself and give in charity.&quot; They said, &quot;If he cannot work or does not work?&quot; He said, &quot;Then he should help the oppressed unhappy person (by word or action or both).&quot; They said, &quot;If he does not do it?&quot; He said, &quot;Then he should enjoin what is good (or said what is reasonable).&apos; They said, &quot;If he does not do that&apos;&apos;&apos; He said, &quot;Then he should refrain from doing evil, for that will be considered for Him as a Sadaqa (charity) . &quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&apos;b:
that he heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying, &quot;(Moses) said, &apos;Call me not to account for what I forget and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you)&apos; (18.73) the first excuse of Moses was his forgetfulness.&quot;
Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib that once he had a guest, so he told his family (on the Day of Id-ul-Adha) that they should slaughter the animal for sacrifice before he returned from the (&apos;Id) prayer in order that their guest could take his meal. So his family slaughtered (the animal ) before the prayer. Then they mentioned that event to the Prophet who ordered Al-Bara to slaughter another sacrifice. Al-Bara&apos; said to the Prophet , &quot;I have a young milch she-goat which is better than two sheep for slaughtering.&quot; (The sub-narrator, Ibn &apos;Aun used to say, &quot;I don&apos;t know whether the permission (to slaughter a she-goat as a sacrifice) was especially given to Al-Bara&apos; or if it was in general for all the Muslims.&quot;) (See Hadith No. 99, Vol. 2.)</text>

          <text>Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:
We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&apos;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &quot;Come along! I have seen Allah&apos;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&quot; The man said, &quot;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&quot; Abu Musa said, &quot;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).
Once we went to Allah&apos;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&apos;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &quot;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&quot;) The Prophet said, &apos;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&apos; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&apos;s Apostle and he said, &quot;Where are those Ash&apos;ariyin? Where are those Ash&apos;ariyin?&quot; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &apos;We went to Allah&apos;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&apos;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&apos;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&apos;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&apos; We returned and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&apos; &quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&apos;s Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &quot;I do not know how to read.&quot; (The Prophet added), &quot;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read,&quot; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&quot; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &quot;Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous...up to..... ..that which he knew not.&quot; (96.15)
Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &quot;Cover me! Cover me!&quot; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &quot;O Khadija, what is wrong with me?&quot; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &apos;I fear that something may happen to me.&quot; Khadija said, &apos;Never! But have the glad tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&quot; Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&apos;s brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &quot;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.&quot; Waraqa asked, &quot;O my nephew! What have you seen?&quot; The Prophet described whatever he had seen.
Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle asked, &quot;Will they turn me out?&quot; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: &quot;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, &quot;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&apos;s Apostle in truth&quot; whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &apos;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &apos;He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&apos; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night).</text>

The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &quot;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&quot; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &quot;Wait till I get you permission.&quot; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&quot; He said, &quot;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&quot; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &apos;Umar came and I said (to him), &quot;Wait till I get you permission.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&quot; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &apos;Uthman came and I said (to him), &quot;Wait till I get permission for you.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&quot; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &quot;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &apos;Uthman is separate from theirs.&quot;)</text>

          <text>Narrated Abu Dhar:
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered: &apos;Gabriel.&apos; He asked, &apos;Is there anyone with you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&apos; He asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Yes.&apos; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; He replied, &apos;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&apos;
Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &quot;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &quot;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; The Prophet asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Idris.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;I passed by Moses and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Moses.&apos; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; I asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Jesus.
Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&quot; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &quot;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &apos;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&apos; I replied, &apos;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &apos;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &apos;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &apos;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&apos; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &apos;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&apos; Then Gabriel took me till we &apos;&apos; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&quot;</text>

Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then raise my head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit whom I will admit into Paradise.
I will come back again, and when I see my Lord (again), I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise, I will return again, and when I see my Lord, I will fall down (in prostration) and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise. I will come back and say, &apos;O my Lord! None remains in Hell (Fire) but those whom Qur&apos;an has imprisoned therein and for whom eternity in Hell (Fire) has become inevitable.&apos; &quot;
The Prophet added, &quot;There will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos;La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos; La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos;La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant).&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated &apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid Al-Laithi:
On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, &apos;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that thing),&apos; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will (deny Him and) say, &apos;We will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&apos; So Allah will come to them in His appearance which they know, and will say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will say, &apos;You are our Lord,&apos; so they will follow Him.
Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&apos; I and my followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &apos;O Allah, save! Save!&apos; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&apos;dan? &quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan, but none knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the mud of the torrent.
Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &apos;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&apos; So he will invoke Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &apos;If I grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&apos; He will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand.
So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, &apos;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&apos; Allah will say to him, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are!&apos; He will say, &apos;O my lord,&apos; and will keep on invoking Allah till He says to him, &apos;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&apos;
Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been given?&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are! &apos;
The man will say, &apos;O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of Your creation,&apos; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him, &apos;Enter Paradise,&apos; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &apos;Wish for anything.&apos; So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &apos;(Wish for) so-and-so.&apos; When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &apos;This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well.&quot;
&apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid added: Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that Allah had said, &quot;That is for you and its equal as well,&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri said, &quot;And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!&quot; Abu Huraira said, &quot;I do not remember, except his saying, &apos;That is for you and its equal as well.&apos;&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri then said, &quot;I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, &apos;That is for you, and ten times as much.&apos; &apos; Abu Huraira then added, &quot;That man will be the last person of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise.&quot;
Narrated Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri:
We said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?&quot; We said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&quot; The Prophet then said, &quot;Somebody will then announce, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&apos; So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &quot;What did you use to worship?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; Then it will be said to them &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &apos;What did you use to worship?&apos;
They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?&apos; They will say, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &apos;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&apos; They will say, &apos;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&apos; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&apos; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &apos;I am your Lord,&apos; and they will say, &apos;You are not our Lord.&apos; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &apos;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&apos; They will say. &apos;The Shin,&apos; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&quot; We, the companions of the Prophet said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&apos;
He said, &quot;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&apos;dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe.
They will say, &apos;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.&apos; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&apos; They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse:--
&apos;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&apos; (4.40) The Prophet added, &quot;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, &apos;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life.
They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &apos;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&apos; Then it will be said to them, &apos;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&apos;&quot;
Narrated Anas:
The Prophet said, &quot;The believers will be kept (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say, &quot;Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from our place.
Then they will go to Adam and say, &apos;You are Adam, the father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours? Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; He will mention his mistakes he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He will add, &apos;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&apos; The people will go to Noah who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking&apos; He will mention his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&apos; He will say (to them), &apos;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&apos; They will go to Abraham who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). &apos;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought near Him, for conversation.&apos;
They will go to Moses who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to them), &apos;Go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by Allah.&apos; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&apos;s permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&apos; Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me. Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them out and make them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the Prophet said, &quot;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I will be permitted.
When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&apos; &quot; The Prophet added, &quot;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &apos;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter.
When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him, and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;Raise your head, O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&apos; So I will raise my head and praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &quot;So I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for eternal life in the fire).&quot; The narrator then recited the Verse:-- &quot;It may be that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&apos; (17.79) The narrator added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet.</text>

&apos;Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you&apos; Moses asked Allah how to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it was said to him, &apos;When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you will meet him.&apos; So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea.

          <text>Narrated Ma&apos;bad bin Hilal Al&apos;Anzi:
We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, &quot;Do not ask him about anything else first but the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; He said, &quot;O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; Anas then said, &quot;Muhammad talked to us saying, &apos;On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, &apos;Please intercede for us with your Lord.&apos; He will say, &apos;I am not fit for that but you&apos;d better go to Abraham as he is the Khalil of the Beneficent.&apos; They will go to Abraham and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.&apos; So they will go to Moses and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was) they will go to Jesus and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad.&apos;
They would come to me and I would say, &apos;I am for that.&apos; Then I will ask for my Lord&apos;s permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; And then it will be said, &apos;Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; It will be said, &apos;Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, &apos;O, Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers!&apos; Then He will say, &apos;Go and take out (all those) in whose hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the Fire.&apos; I will go and do so.&quot;&apos;
When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, &quot;Let&apos;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&quot; So we went to him and we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, &quot;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I have never heard.&quot; He said, &quot;What is that?&quot; Then we told him of the Hadith and said, &quot;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&quot; He said, &quot;What then?&quot; We said, &quot;He did not add anything to that.&quot; He said, Anas related the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&apos;t know whether he forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&quot; We said, &quot;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&quot; He smiled and said, &quot;Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it.
Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet added, &apos;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as he &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted .&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, &apos;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&apos; Then Allah will say, &apos;By my Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: &apos;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&apos; &apos;&apos;</text>

          <text>Narrated Anas bin Malik:
The night Allah&apos;s Apostle was taken for a journey from the sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka&apos;ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, &quot;Which of them is he?&quot; The middle (second) angel said, &quot;He is the best of them.&quot; The last (third) angle said, &quot;Take the best of them.&quot; Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not----and so is the case with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on one of its doors.
The dwellers of the Heaven asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; He said, &quot;Gabriel.&quot; They said, &quot;Who is accompanying you?&quot; He said, &quot;Muhammad.&quot; They said, &quot;Has he been called?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes&quot; They said, &quot;He is welcomed.&quot; So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless Allah informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the Prophet, &quot;He is your father; greet him.&quot; The Prophet greeted him and Adam returned his greeting and said, &quot;Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!&quot; Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, &quot;What are these two rivers, O Gabriel?&quot; Gabriel said, &quot;These are the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates.&quot;
Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, &quot;What is this, O Gabriel?&quot; Gabriel said, &quot;This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for you.&quot; Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., &quot;Who is it?&quot; Gabriel replied, &quot;Gabriel&quot;. They asked, &quot;Who is accompanying you?&quot; He said, &quot;Muhammad.&quot; They asked, &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then they said, &quot;He is welcomed.&apos;&apos; Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the second Heavens had said.
Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don&apos;t remember, on the fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), &quot;O Lord! I thought that none would be raised up above me.&quot;
But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: &quot;Fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.&quot;
Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped him and asked, &quot;O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?&quot; The Prophet replied,&quot; He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a night.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord may reduce it for you and for them.&quot; So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, &quot;Yes, if you wish.&quot; So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in his place, &quot;O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that.&quot; So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to only five prayers.
Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and said, &quot;O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten your burden.&quot;
The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said, &quot;O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so lighten our burden.&quot; On that the Irresistible said, &quot;O Muhammad!&quot; the Prophet replied, &quot;Labbaik and Sa&apos;daik.&quot; Allah said, &quot;The Word that comes from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book.&quot; Allah added, &quot;Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in practice).&quot;
The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, &quot;What have you done?&quot; He said, &quot;He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward.&quot; Moses said, &quot;By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten your burden further.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too many times to my Lord.&quot; On that Gabriel said, &quot;Descend in Allah&apos;s Name.&quot; The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca).</text>

          <text>Narrated Musa bin Abi &apos;Aisha:
Sa&apos;id bin Jubair reported from Ibn &apos;Abbas (regarding the explanation of the Verse: &apos;Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&apos;an) to make haste therewith) . He said, &quot;The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.&apos; Ibn &apos;Abbas said (to Sa&apos;id), &quot;I move them (my lips) as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to move his lips.&quot; And Said said (to me), &quot;I move my lips as I saw Ibn &apos;Abbas moving his lips,&quot; and then he moved his lips. So Allah revealed:--
&apos;(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&apos;an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).&apos; (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow you its recital.&apos; (75.18) This means, &quot;You should listen to it and keep quiet and then it is upon Us to make you recite it.&quot;
The narrator added, &quot;So Allah&apos;s Apostle used to listen whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur&apos;an as Gabriel had recited it to him.&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Zahdam:
There were good relations and brotherhood between this tribe of Jurm and the Ash&apos;ariyyin. Once, while we were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&apos;ari, there was brought to him a meal which contained chicken meat, and there was sitting beside him, a man from the tribe of Bani Taimul-lah who looked like one of the Mawali. Abu Musa invited the man to eat but the man said, &quot;I have seen chicken eating some dirty things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken.&quot; Abu Musa said to him, &quot;Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet with a few men from Ash&apos;ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Allah, I will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.&apos; Then a few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying, &apos;Where are the group of Ash&apos;ariyyin?&apos; So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us and then we set out. We said, &apos;What have we done? Allah&apos;s Apostle took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided us with mounts. We made Allah&apos;s Apostle forget his oath! By Allah, we will never be successful.&apos; So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, &apos;I have not provided you with the mount, but Allah has done so. By Allah, I may take an oath to do something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and make the expiation for my oath.&apos; &quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Abu Musa:
The Prophet said, &apos;The example of a believer who recites the Qur&apos;an is that of a citron (a citrus fruit) which is good in taste and good in smell. And the believer who does not recite the Quran is like a date which has a good taste but no smell. And the example of an impious person who recites the Qur&apos;an is that of Ar-Rihana (an aromatic plant) which smells good but is bitter in taste. And the example of an impious person who does not recite the Quran is that of a colocynth which is bitter in taste and has no smell.&quot;</text>
