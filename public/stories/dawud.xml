Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days); pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you.&quot; I replied, &quot;I have more power than that (fasting).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Then fast like the fasts of (the Prophet) David&quot;. I said, &quot;How?&quot; He replied, &quot;He used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy.&quot; I said, &quot;From where can I get that chance?&quot; (&apos;Ata&apos; said, &quot;I do not know how the expression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred.&quot;) So, the Prophet said, twice, &quot;Whoever fasts daily throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all.&quot;</text>

          <text>Narrated Ibn Juraij:
Ya&apos;la bin Muslim and &apos;Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair.
Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &apos;Abbas, Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;Ask me (any question)&quot; I said, &quot;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&apos;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&quot; As for &apos;Amr, he said to me, &quot;Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&quot; But Ya&apos;la said to me, &quot;Ibn &apos;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&apos;b said, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Once Moses, Allah&apos;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&apos; Moses replied, &apos;No.&apos; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &apos;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord! Where is he?&apos; Allah said, &apos;At the junction of the two seas.&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&apos; &quot; &apos;Amr said to me, Allah said, &quot;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&quot; Ya&apos;la said to me, &quot;Allah said (to Moses), &apos;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&apos; &quot; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &quot;I don&apos;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&quot; He said (to Moses).&quot; You have not demanded too much.&quot; And that is as mentioned by Allah:
&apos;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant .... &apos; (18.60) Yusha&apos; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &quot;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &quot;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &apos;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &quot;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&quot; Moses said &quot;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&quot; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &apos;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &apos;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &quot;What do you want?&apos; Moses said, &apos; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&apos; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &apos;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&apos;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&apos; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &apos;The pious slave of Allah.&apos; (We said to Said &quot;Was that Khadir?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot;) The boat men said, &apos;We will not get him on board with fare.&apos; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &apos;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &quot;Moses said so protestingly.&quot;) Al-Khadir said, didn&apos;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&apos; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &apos;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&apos; (18.73)
(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&apos;la- said: Said said &apos;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &apos;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&apos; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &apos;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&apos;la said, &apos;I think Said said, &apos;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &apos;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &apos;Wages that we might had eaten.&apos; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&quot; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &apos;Abbas recited: &apos;In front of them (was) a king.&apos;
It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &apos;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &apos;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&apos; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &apos;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&apos; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&apos; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&apos;? (18.74). &apos;Near to mercy&quot; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&apos;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &apos;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</text>

David prostrated, so Allah&apos;s Apostle (Muhammad) performed this prostration too.&apos;</text>

          <text>Narrated &apos;Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-As:
My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, &quot;What a wonderful man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.&quot; When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, &quot;Let me meet him.&quot; Then I met him and he asked me, &quot;How do you fast?&quot; I replied, &quot;I fast daily,&quot; He asked, &quot;How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Quran?&quot; I replied, &quot;I finish it every night.&quot; On that he said, &quot;Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&apos;an (and finish it) in one month.&quot; I said, &quot;But I have power to do more than that.&quot; He said, &quot;Then fast for three days per week.&quot; I said, &quot;i have the power to do more than that.&quot; He said, &quot;Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur&apos;an In seven days.&quot; I wish I had accepted the permission of Allah&apos;s Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is said that &apos;Abdullah used to recite one-seventh of the Qur&apos;an during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet.</text>

I hope that you will have a long life, and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed, is multiplied ten times, that means, as if you fasted the whole year.&quot; I insisted (on fasting more) so I was given a hard instruction.

The news of my fasting was mentioned to the Prophet . So he entered upon me and I put for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm-fibres. The Prophet sat on the floor and the cushion was between me and him. He said to me, &quot;Isn&apos;t it sufficient for you (that you fast) three days a month?&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle!
