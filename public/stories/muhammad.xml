      <text>Muhammad (SAW) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, it then becomes thick, and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad SAW till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise).</text>

      <text>Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, what has been hallowed to other than God, the beast strangled; the beast beaten down, the beast fallen to death, the beast gored, and that devoured by beasts of prey - excepting that you have sacrificed duly -- as also things sacrificed to idols, and partition by the divining arrows; that is ungodliness. Today the unbelievers have despaired of your religion; therefore fear them not, but fear you Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion. But whosoever is constrained in emptiness and not inclining purposely to sin -- God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate.</text>

He knows that you are unable to pray the whole night, so He has turned to you (in mercy). So, recite you of the Quran as much as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be some among you sick, others travelling through the land, seeking of Allah&apos;s Bounty; yet others fighting in Allah&apos;s Cause. So recite as much of the Quran as may be easy (for you), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and lend to Allah a goodly loan, and whatever good you send before you for yourselves, (i.e. Nawafil non-obligatory acts of worship: prayers, charity, fasting, Hajj and &apos;Umrah, etc.), you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward.

      <text>Have you not seen those who were told to stop fighting, to say their prayers, and pay the religious tax? When they were ordered to fight, some of them feared other men as much as or more than they feared God and so they said, &quot;Lord, why have you ordered us to fight? If only you would give us a little time.&quot; (Muhammad), tell them, &quot;The pleasures of the worldly life are trivial. The life hereafter is best for the pious ones.

Anas bin Malik said, &quot;Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight (in Allah&apos;s cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack them.&quot; Anas added, &quot;We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the Prophet.
The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and when they saw the Prophet they shouted &apos;Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad and his army.&apos; When Allah&apos;s Apostle saw them, he said, &quot;Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined.

The people said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle!

He said, &quot;You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, &apos;I am Your Lord.&apos; They will say, &apos;We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will say, &apos;You are our Lord.&apos; Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, &apos;O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.&apos;
There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa&apos;dan in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa&apos;dan?&quot; The people said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa&apos;dan but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, &apos;O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.&apos; Allah will ask him, &quot;Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?&apos; He will say, &quot;No by Your (Honor) Power!&quot; And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, &apos;O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.&apos; Allah will ask him, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?&apos; He will say, &apos;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will say, &apos;No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.&apos; Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, &apos;O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.&apos; Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven&apos;t you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?&apos; He will say, &apos;O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.&apos; So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Allah will say, &apos;Request more of such and such things.&apos; Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say &quot;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&quot; Abu Said Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, &apos;Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Allah said, &apos;That is for you and ten times more like it.&apos; &quot;Abu Huraira said, &quot;I do not remember from Allah&apos;s Apostle except (his saying), &apos;All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides.&quot; Abu Sahd said, &quot;I heard him saying, &apos;That is for you and ten times more the like of it.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Aisha:
Once in the middle of the night Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Allah&apos;s Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited &quot;Tashah-hud&quot; (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said, &quot;Amma ba&apos;du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud) might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out.&quot;</text>

Once the Prophet ascended the pulpit and it was the last gathering in which he took part. He was covering his shoulder with a big cloak and binding his head with an oily bandage. He glorified and praised Allah and said, &quot;O people! Come to me.&quot; So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, &quot;Amma ba&apos;du.&quot; &quot;From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers.&quot;</text>

We were with &apos;Abdullah and he said, &quot;When the Prophet saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, &quot;O Allah! Send (famine) years on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet) Joseph.&quot; So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Muhammad! You order people to obey Allah and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so please pray to Allah for them.&quot; So Allah revealed: &quot;Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.

One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, &quot;When Quraish delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Allah to curse them, so they were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &apos;O Muhammad!

So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: &apos;Then watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.&apos; (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Allah, (in Sura &quot;Ad-Dukhan&quot;-44) refers to that: &apos;On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.&apos; (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the battle of Badr.&quot; Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
(the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&apos;s Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &quot;I do not know how to read.
The Prophet added, &quot;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, &apos;I do not know how to read.&apos; Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, &apos;I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?&apos; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, &apos;Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.&quot; (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, &quot;Cover me! Cover me!&quot; They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, &quot;I fear that something may happen to me.&quot; Khadija replied, &quot;Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.&quot;
Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, &quot;Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!&quot; Waraqa asked, &quot;O my nephew! What have you seen?&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle asked, &quot;Will they drive me out?&quot; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, &quot;Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.
Narrated Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah Al-Ansari while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet &quot;While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira&apos; sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, &apos;Wrap me (in blankets).&apos; And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran):
&apos;O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in garments!&apos; Arise and warn (the people against Allah&apos;s Punishment),... up to &apos;and desert the idols.&apos; (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Said bin Jubair:
Ibn &apos;Abbas in the explanation of the Statement of Allah. &apos;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&quot; (75.16) Said &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas moved his lips saying, &quot;I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to move his.&quot; Said moved his lips saying: &quot;I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn &apos;Abbas moving his.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas added, &quot;So Allah revealed &apos;Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur&apos;an) to make haste therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur&apos;an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur&apos;an which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The Statement of Allah: And &apos;When we have recited it to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur&apos;an) recital&apos; (75.18) means &apos;listen to it and be silent.&apos; Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to you&apos; (75.19) means &apos;Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah&apos;s Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Abbas:
Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allah&apos;s Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius&apos;s question said to them, &quot;Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&quot; Abu Sufyan replied, &quot;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&quot;
Heraclius said, &quot;Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:
&apos;What is his family status amongst you?&apos;
I replied, &apos;He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.&apos;
Heraclius further asked, &apos;Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&apos;
I replied, &apos;No.&apos;
He said, &apos;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&apos;
I replied, &apos;No.&apos;
Heraclius asked, &apos;Do the nobles or the poor follow him?&apos;
I replied, &apos;It is the poor who follow him.&apos;
He said, &apos;Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?&apos;
I replied, &apos;They are increasing.&apos;
He then asked, &apos;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&apos;
I replied, &apos;No.&apos;
Heraclius said, &apos;Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&apos;
I replied, &apos;No. &apos;
Heraclius said, &apos;Does he break his promises?&apos;
I replied, &apos;No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.&apos; I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.
Heraclius asked, &apos;Have you ever had a war with him?&apos;
I replied, &apos;Yes.&apos;
Then he said, &apos;What was the outcome of the battles?&apos;
I replied, &apos;Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&apos;
Heraclius said, &apos;What does he order you to do?&apos;
I said, &apos;He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.&apos;
Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&apos;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.
I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&apos; Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allah&apos;s Apostle which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &quot;In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah&apos;s Statement:)
&apos;O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allah).&apos; (3:64).
Abu Sufyan then added, &quot;When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided me to it).&quot;
The sub narrator adds, &quot;Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya&apos; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&apos; (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &apos;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&apos; The people replied, &apos;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews).
&apos;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.&apos;
While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allah&apos;s Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &apos;Arabs also practice circumcision.&apos;
(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the &apos;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &apos;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&apos;
(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.
(When they returned) he said, &apos;What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&apos; The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&apos;s story (in connection with his faith).</text>

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to teach us the way of doing Istikhara (Istikhara means to ask Allah to guide one to the right sort of action concerning any job or a deed), in all matters as he taught us the Suras of the Quran. He said, &quot;If anyone of you thinks of doing any job he should offer a two Rakat prayer other than the compulsory ones and say (after the prayer): -- &apos;Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi&apos;ilmika, Wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, Wa as&apos;alaka min fadlika al-&apos;azlm Fa-innaka taqdiru Wala aqdiru, Wa ta&apos;lamu Wala a&apos;lamu, Wa anta &apos;allamu l-ghuyub.

You know and I do not and You know the unseen. O Allah! If You know that this job is good for my religion and my subsistence and in my Hereafter--(or said: If it is better for my present and later needs)--Then You ordain it for me and make it easy for me to get, And then bless me in it, and if You know that this job is harmful to me In my religion and subsistence and in the Hereafter--(or said: If it is worse for my present and later needs)--Then keep it away from me and let me be away from it. And ordain for me whatever is good for me, And make me satisfied with it). The Prophet added that then the person should name (mention) his need.</text>

When Abu Talha came, he asked, &quot;How is the boy?&quot; She said, &quot;The child is quiet and I hope he is in peace.&quot; Abu Talha thought that she had spoken the truth. Abu Talha passed the night and in the morning took a bath and when he intended to go out, she told him that his son had died, Abu Talha offered the (morning) prayer with the Prophet and informed the Prophet of what happened to them. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;May Allah bless you concerning your night. (That is, may Allah bless you with good offspring).&quot; Sufyan said, &quot;One of the Ansar said, &apos;They (i.e. Abu Talha and his wife) had nine sons and all of them became reciters of the Quran (by heart).&apos; &quot;</text>

When the news of the martyrdom of Zaid bin Haritha, Ja&apos;far and &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha came, the Prophet sat down looking sad, and I was looking through the chink of the door. A man came and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! The women of Ja&apos;far,&quot; and then he mentioned their crying . The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered h im to stop them from crying. The man went and came back and said, &quot;I tried to stop them but they disobeyed.&quot; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) ordered him for the second time to forbid them. He went again and came back and said, &quot;They did not listen to me, (or &quot;us&quot;: the sub-narrator Muhammad bin Haushab is in doubt as to which is right). &quot; (&apos;Aisha added: The Prophet said, &quot;Put dust in their mouths.&quot; I said (to that man), &quot;May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. humiliate you).&quot; By Allah, you could not (stop the women from crying) to fulfill the order, besides you did not relieve Allah&apos;s Apostle from fatigue.&quot;</text>

Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &quot;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&quot; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &quot;Ma sha&apos;a-llah&quot; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &apos;What Allah wished,&apos; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &quot;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &apos;What is this?&apos; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.
The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &apos;Who is this?&apos; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &apos;Who is this?&apos; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &apos;What is this?&apos; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.
Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &apos;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&apos; They said, &apos;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.
The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&apos; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &apos;That is your place.&apos; I said, &apos;Let me enter my place.&apos; They said, &apos;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&apos; &quot;</text>

Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&apos; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&quot; (So, Ibn &apos;Umar conveyed the message to &apos;Aisha.) She said, &quot;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&apos;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&quot; When &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar returned, &apos;Umar asked him, &quot;What (news) do you have?&quot; He replied, &quot;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&quot; On that &apos;Umar said, &quot;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&apos;Aisha ) and say, &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&quot; and then he mentioned the name of &apos;Uthman, &apos;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin &apos;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.
By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &quot;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&apos;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&quot; &apos;Umar replied, &quot;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&quot;</text>

&apos; Aisha said, &quot;We set out with Allah&apos;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &quot;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &apos; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &quot;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &quot;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&quot; I replied, &quot;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&quot; He asked, &quot;What is wrong with you?&apos; I replied, &apos; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&apos; He said, &apos; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&quot; Aisha further added, &quot;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; Aisha added, &quot;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&quot; He called &apos; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &apos; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &apos; Umra, and when you had finished &apos; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&apos; &quot; &apos; Aisha added, &apos; &apos; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &apos; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &apos;Have you performed the &apos; Umra?&apos; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&apos;&apos;</text>

And then &apos;Umar did the same. Then &apos;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and it was not &apos;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and it was not &apos;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &apos;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &apos;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &apos;Umar, and he did not do another &apos;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &apos;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &apos;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Urwa:
I asked &apos;Aisha : &quot;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&apos;ba or performs &apos;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&quot; &apos;Aisha said, &quot;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &apos;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&apos; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &quot;Manat&quot; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.
When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&quot; So Allah revealed: &apos;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&apos; &quot; Aisha added, &quot;Surely, Allah&apos;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&quot; Later on I (&apos;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &apos;Abdur-Rahman (of &apos;Aisha&apos;s narration) and he said, &apos;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &apos;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.
When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&apos; So Allah revealed: &quot;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba.&apos;</text>

&quot;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah.

When Islam came, they asked Allah&apos;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:--
&quot;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah.

Their Prophet then said, &quot;What if you are ordered to fight and you disobey?&quot; They said, &quot;Why should we not fight for the cause of God when we and our sons have been expelled from our homes?&quot; However, when they were ordered to fight, all refused except a few among them.

Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret.&quot; They said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! We cannot come to you except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them).&quot; Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah Alone and asked them, &quot;Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?&quot; They replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; Thereupon the Prophet said, &quot;It means:
1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&apos;s Apostle.
2. To offer prayers perfectly
3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)
4. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.
5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah&apos;s Cause).
Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,&apos; Naqir Ann Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and he meant the wine itself).

&quot;The Prophet sent a messenger to the village of the Ansar in the morning of the day of &apos;Ashura&apos; (10th of Muharram) to announce: &apos;Whoever has eaten something should not eat but complete the fast, and whoever is observing the fast should complete it.&apos; &quot;She further said, &quot;Since then we used to fast on that day regularly and also make our boys fast. We used to make toys of wool for the boys and if anyone of them cried for, he was given those toys till it was the time of the breaking of the fast.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Umar:
I was with the Prophet while he was eating spadix. He said, &quot;From the trees there is a tree which resembles a faithful believer.&quot; I wanted to say that it was the date palm, but I was the youngest among them (so I kept quiet). He added, &quot;It is the date palm.&quot; Shuraih told the weavers, &quot;You are permitted to follow your own conventions to solve your problems (it is legal for you to stick to your traditions in bargain) . &quot;
Narrated &apos;Abdul Wahab: Aiyub said: Muhammad said, &quot;There is no harm in selling for eleven what you buy for ten, and you are allowed to take a profit for expenses . &quot;
The Prophet told Hind, &quot;Take what is reasonable and sufficient for you and your sons.&quot; Allah says: Whoever is poor, can eat (from the orphan&apos;s property) reasonably (according to his labors).
Al-Hasan hired a donkey from &apos;Abdullah bin Mirdas and asked him about the hire. The latter replied that it was for two Daniqs (a Daniq equals 116th Dirham). So Al-Hasan rode away. Another time, Al-Hasan came to &apos;Abdullah bin Mirdas and asked him to hire the donkey to him and rode away without asking him about the hire, but he sent him half a Dirham.</text>

Not a single day passed but Allah&apos;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &quot;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, &quot;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?&quot;
So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&apos;s guarantee of protection and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &quot;Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur&apos;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Qur&apos;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&apos;an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &quot;We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&apos;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&apos;s public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&quot;
&apos;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, &quot;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &apos;Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect it.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with Allah&apos;s protection.&quot; At that time Allah&apos;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, &quot;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras.&quot; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Allah&apos;s Apostle said to him, &quot;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to emigrate.&quot; Abu Bakr asked, &quot;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&apos;s Apostle and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months.</text>

      <text>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing Islam, came to Allah&apos;s Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their properties and their captives. Allah&apos;s Apostle said to them, &quot;The most beloved statement to me is the true one. So, you have the option of restoring your properties or your captives, for I have delayed distributing them.&quot; The narrator added, Allah&apos;s Apostle c had been waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that Allah&apos;s Apostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, &quot;We choose our captives.&quot; So, Allah&apos;s Apostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Allah as He deserved, and said, &quot;Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can do so.&quot; The people replied, &quot;We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor for Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;We don&apos;t know who amongst you has agreed and who hasn&apos;t. Go back and your chiefs may tell us your opinion.&quot; So, all of them returned and their chiefs discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came to Allah&apos;s Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given up their shares gladly and willingly.</text>

While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, &quot;O Aba-l-Qasim ! What is the spirit?&quot; The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet then said, &quot;And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little).&quot; (17.85)</text>

While Allah&apos;s Apostle was sitting, a Jew came and said, &quot;O Abul Qasim! One of your companions has slapped me on my face.&quot; The Prophet asked who that was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet sent for him, and on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He (replied in the affirmative and) said, &quot;I heard him taking an oath in the market saying, &apos;By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the human beings.&apos; I said, &apos;O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses superiority) even over Muhammad I became furious
and slapped him over his face.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do not give a prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth, and will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the first unconsciousness was sufficient for him.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Aisha:
(the wife of the Prophet) &quot;Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allah&apos;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept.
Safwan bin Mu&apos;attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, &quot;Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).&quot; He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, &apos;How is that (girl)?&apos; I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &apos;Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &apos;Let Mistah be ruined.&apos; I said, &apos;You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr?&apos; She said, &apos;O Hanata (you there) didn&apos;t you hear what they said?&apos; Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers.
My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, &apos;How is that (girl)?&apos; I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Allah&apos;s Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &apos;What are the people talking about?&apos; She said, &apos;O my daughter! Don&apos;t worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.&apos; I said, &apos;Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter?&apos; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allah&apos;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. &apos;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&apos; &apos;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth.&apos; On that Allah&apos;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &apos;O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her?&apos; Buraira said, &apos;No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&apos; On that day Allah&apos;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Who will support me to punish that person (&apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company.&apos;
Sad bin Mu&apos;adh got up and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! by Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.&apos; On that Sad bin &apos;Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, &apos;By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him.&apos; On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin &apos;Ubada), &apos;By Allah! you are a liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.&apos; On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Allah&apos;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep.
In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, &apos;O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&apos; When Allah&apos;s Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; I said to my mother, &apos;Talk to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.
I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Quran. I said. &apos;I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Allah, I don&apos;t compare my situation with you except to the situation of Joseph&apos;s father (i.e. Jacob) who said, &apos;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.&apos; Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur&apos;an. I had hoped that Allah&apos;s Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah&apos;s Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, &apos;Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has declared your innocence.&apos; My mother told me to go to Allah&apos;s Apostle . I replied, &apos;By Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.&apos; So Allah revealed: &quot;Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .&quot; (24.11)
When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, &apos;By Allah, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.&apos; But Allah later revealed: --
&quot;And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah&apos;s Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you? Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot; (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, &apos;Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,&apos; and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before.
Allah&apos;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s wife about me saying, &apos;What do you know and what did you see?&apos; She replied, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&quot; Aisha further added &quot;Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet&apos;s love), yet Allah protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety.&quot;</text>

When the Prophet intended to perform &apos;Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: &apos;These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah&apos;s Apostle agreed (to make peace).&apos; They said, &quot;We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Allah&apos;s Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin &apos;Abdullah.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;I am Allah&apos;s Apostle and also Muhammad bin &apos;Abdullah.&quot; Then he said to &apos;Ali, &quot;Rub off (the words) &apos;Allah&apos;s Apostle&apos; &quot;, but &apos;Ali said, &quot;No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.&quot; So, Allah&apos;s Apostle took the document and wrote, &apos;This is what Muhammad bin &apos;Abdullah has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.&apos; When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the Meccans went to &apos;Ali and said, &quot;Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed.&quot; So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, &quot;O Uncle! O Uncle!&quot; &apos;Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, &quot;Take your uncle&apos;s daughter.&quot; Zaid and Ja&apos;far quarrel ed about her. &apos;Ali said, &quot;I have more right to her as she is my uncle&apos;s daughter.&quot; Ja&apos;far said, &quot;She is my uncle&apos;s daughter, and her aunt is my wife.&quot; Zaid said, &quot;She is my brother&apos;s daughter.&quot; The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to &apos;All, &quot;You are from me and I am from you&quot;, and said to Ja&apos;far, &quot;You resemble me both in character and appearance&quot;, and said to Zaid, &quot;You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave.&quot;</text>

      <text>O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the Cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you (by embracing Islam): &quot;You are not a believer&quot;; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah.

When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar&apos;s hands and feet, Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, &quot;No doubt, Allah&apos;s Apostle made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and said to them, &apos;We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah allows you.&apos; Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them.&quot; When Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq&apos;s came and addressed &apos;Umar, &quot;O chief of the believers, will you exile us although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah&apos;s Apostle, i.e.: What will your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?&quot; The Jew replied, &quot;That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;O the enemy of Allah!

      <text>Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan:
(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&apos;s Apostle set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &quot;Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&quot; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&apos; (i.e. the she-camel&apos;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&apos; has become stubborn!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&apos; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&quot; Then he said, &quot;By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&quot;
The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to Allah&apos;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&apos;i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza&apos;a and they were the advisers of Allah&apos;s Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &quot;I left Kab bin Luai and &apos;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &apos;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e. the &apos;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&quot; Budail said, &quot;I will inform them of what you have said.&quot; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, &quot;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to you if you should like.&quot; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said, &quot;Relate what you heard him saying.&quot; Budail said, &quot;I heard him saying so-and-so,&quot; relating what the Prophet had told him.
Urwa bin Mas&apos;ud got up and said, &quot;O people! Aren&apos;t you the sons? They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He added, &quot;Am I not the father?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you mistrust me?&quot; They said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Don&apos;t you know that I invited the people of &apos;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you&apos;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&quot; They said, &quot;You may meet him.&quot; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &quot;O Muhammad! Won&apos;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&quot; Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &quot;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?&quot; Urwa said, &quot;Who is that man?&quot; They said, &quot;He is Abu Bakr.&quot; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &quot;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&quot; Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&apos;s beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu&apos;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &quot;Remove your hand from the beard of Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Urwa raised his head and asked, &quot;Who is that?&quot; The people said, &quot;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&apos;ba.&quot; Urwa said, &quot;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?&quot;
Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him, &quot;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, &quot;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect.&quot; Urwa added, &quot;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it.&quot; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &quot;Allow me to go to him,&quot; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allah&apos;s Ap le I said, &quot;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of him.&quot; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &quot;Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; When he returned to his people, he said, &apos;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, &quot;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&quot; Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came.
When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &quot;Now the matter has become easy.&quot; Suhail said to the Prophet &quot;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&quot; So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &quot;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;As for &apos;Beneficent,&apos; by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously.&quot; The Muslims said, &quot;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Write: By Your Name O Allah.&quot; Then he dictated, &quot;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah&apos;s Apostle has concluded.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;By Allah, if we knew that you are Allah&apos;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: &quot;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&quot; (Az-Zuhri said, &quot;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his companions perform &apos;Umra.)&quot; The Prophet said to Suhail, &quot;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&apos;ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;By Allah, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the &apos;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year.&quot; So, the Prophet got that written.
Then Suhail said, &quot;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&quot; The Muslims said, &quot;Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &apos;Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &quot;O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;The peace treaty has not been written yet.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;I will never allow you to keep him.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes, do.&quot; He said, &quot;I won&apos;t do.: Mikraz said, &quot;We allow you (to keep him).&quot; Abu Jandal said, &quot;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&apos;t you see how much I have suffered?&quot;
Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &quot;I went to the Prophet and said, &apos;Aren&apos;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;Yes, indeed.&apos; I said, &apos;Isn&apos;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&apos; He said, &apos;I am Allah&apos;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&apos; I said, &apos;Didn&apos;t you tell us that we would go to the Ka&apos;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&apos;ba this year?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;So you will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; &quot; Umar further said, &quot;I went to Abu Bakr and said, &apos;O Abu Bakr! Isn&apos;t he truly Allah&apos;s Prophet?&apos; He replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&apos; He said, &apos;Indeed, he is Allah&apos;s Apostle and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right.&apos; I said, &apos;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the Ka&apos;ba this year?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &quot;You will go to Ka&apos;ba and perform Tawaf around it.&quot; (Az-Zuhri said, &quot; &apos;Umar said, &apos;I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&apos; &quot;)
When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&apos;s Apostle said to his companions, &quot;Get up and&apos; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&quot; By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&apos;s attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, &quot;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and don&apos;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.&quot; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:--
&quot;O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them . . .&quot; (60.10)
Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &quot;Abide by the promise you gave us.&quot; So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, &quot;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&quot; The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &quot;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried it many times.&quot; Abu Bair said, &quot;Let me have a look at it.&quot;
When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah&apos;s Apostle saw him he said, &quot;This man appears to have been frightened.&quot; When he reached the Prophet he said, &quot;My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.&quot; Abu Basir came and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me from them.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only have supporters.&quot; When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir&apos;s companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine Verses:
&quot;And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance.&quot; (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to write: &quot;In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,&quot; and prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka&apos;ba.
Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, &quot;Aisha told me that Allah&apos;s Apostle used to examine the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their wives, &apos;Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza&apos;i. Later on Mu&apos;awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other.&quot;
When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah revealed: &quot;And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).&quot; (60.11)
So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands.
We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to return Abu Basir.</text>

Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked &apos;Aisha about the meaning of the Quranic Verse:--
&quot;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&quot; (4.2-3)
Aisha said, &quot;It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people asked Allah&apos;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:--
&quot;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them...&quot; (4.127)
and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights.</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Bu&apos;ath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, i.e. Khazraj and Aus, before Islam.) The Prophet reclined on the bed and turned his face to the other side. Abu Bakr came and scolded me and said protestingly, &quot;Instrument of Satan in the presence of Allah&apos;s Apostle?&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle turned his face towards him and said, &quot;Leave them.&quot; When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I waved the two girls to go away and they left.

      <text>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas:
Allah&apos;s Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered to hand it over to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said after reading t, &apos;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about Allah&apos;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been concluded between Allah&apos;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said, Caesar&apos;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar&apos;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator. &apos;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a prophet.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;I replied, &apos;I am the nearest relative to him.&apos; He asked, &apos;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;He is my cousin,&apos; and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &apos;Let him come nearer.&apos; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his translator, &apos;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his translator, &apos;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&apos; I replied, &apos;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&apos; He said, &apos;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before him? &apos;I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he claimed? &apos; I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&apos; I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &quot;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&apos; I replied, &apos;It is the poor who follow him.&apos; He said, &apos;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by day)?&apos; I replied,&apos; They are increasing.&apos; He said, &apos;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his (the Prophet&apos;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&apos;. I replied, &apos;No. &apos; He said, &apos;Does he break his promises? I replied, &apos;No, but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;Other than the last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &apos;Have you ever had a war with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;What was the outcome of your battles with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&apos; He said, &apos;What does he order you to do?&apos; I said, &apos;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.&apos; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &apos;Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&apos; &quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle and it was read. Its contents were:--
&quot;In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe; embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64)
Abu Sufyan added, &quot;When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him, and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them, &apos;Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha&apos;s (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s) affair has gained power. This is the King of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah, I remained low and was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I disliked it &quot;</text>

He instructed them, &quot;Stick to your place, and don&apos;t leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you.&quot; Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of &apos;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &quot;The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?&quot; &apos;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &quot;Have you forgotten what Allah&apos;s Apostle said to you?&quot; They replied, &quot;By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.&quot; But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah&apos;s Apostle in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred seventy men from us.
On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had caused the &apos;Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, &quot;Is Muhammad present amongst these people?&quot; The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, &quot;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?&quot; He asked again thrice, &quot;Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?&quot; He then returned to his companions and said, &quot;As for these (men), they have been killed.&quot; &apos;Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), &quot;You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there.&quot; Abu Sufyan said, &quot;Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed&quot; After that he started reciting cheerfully, &quot;O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his companions), &quot;Why don&apos;t you answer him back?&quot; They said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle What shall we say?&quot; He said, &quot;Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.&quot; (Then) Abu Sufyan said, &quot;We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza.&quot; The Prophet said (to his companions), &quot;Why don&apos;t you answer him back?&quot; They asked, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What shall we say?&quot; He said, &quot;Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
Allah&apos;s Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the leadership of &apos;Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of &apos;Asim bin Umar Al-Khattab. They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between &apos;Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, &quot;These are the dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), &quot;and continued following their tracks When &apos;Asim and his companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them. The infidels said to them, &quot;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill any one of you&quot; &apos;Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya said, &quot;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they martyred &apos;Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the third (of the captives) said, &quot;This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.&quot; So, they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin &apos;Amir bin Naufal bin &apos;Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &apos;Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people.
Narrated Az-Zuhri: &apos;Ubaidullah bin &apos;Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, &quot;When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and said, &apos;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&apos; By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.&quot; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &quot;It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.&quot; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &quot;Hadn&apos;t I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no exception.&quot; (He then recited the poetic verse):-- &quot;I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&apos;s Cause, For my killing is for Allah&apos;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&quot; Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer (before being killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) &apos;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from his flesh.</text>

      <text>Narrated Aslam:
Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or other specified animals). He said to him, &quot;O Hunai! Don&apos;t oppress the Muslims and ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin &apos;Auf and the livestock of (&apos;Uthman) bin &apos;Affan, for if their livestock should perish, then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and appeal for help saying, &apos;O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!&apos; Would I then neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims&apos; treasury). By Allah, these people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah&apos;s Cause, I would not have turned even a span of their land into a Hima.&quot;</text>

The Prophet supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra&apos;(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi&apos;r-Ma&apos;ana where they betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan for one month in the prayer.

      <text>Those who avoid great sins (see the Quran, Verses: 6:152, 153) and Al-Fawahish (illegal sexual intercourse, etc.) except the small faults, verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness. He knows you well when He created you from the earth (Adam), and when you were fetuses in your mothers&apos; wombs. So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who fears Allah and keep his duty to Him [i.e. those who are Al-Muttaqun (pious - see V. 2:2)].</text>

      <text>Narrated Malik bin Aus:
While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, &quot;The chief of the believers has sent for you.&quot; So, I went along with him till I entered the place where &apos;Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, &quot;O Malik! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.&quot; I said, &quot;O chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.&quot; He said, &quot;O man! Take it.&quot; While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa&apos; came saying, &quot;&apos;Uthman, &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin &apos;Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Yes&quot;, So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa&apos; came again and said, &quot;May I admit &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;yes.&quot; So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then &apos;Abbas said, &quot;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &apos;Ali).&quot; They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. &apos;Uthman and his companions) said, &quot;O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Be patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Our (i.e. prophets&apos;) property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),&apos; and Allah&apos;s Apostle meant himself (by saying &quot;we&apos;&apos;)?&quot; The group said, &quot;He said so.&quot; &apos;Umar then turned to &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas and said, &quot;I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah&apos;s Apostle said so?&quot; They replied, &quot; He said so.&quot; &apos;Umar then said, &quot;So, I will talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.&quot; &apos;Umar then recited the Holy Verses: &quot;What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them --- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will &apos;And Allah is able to do all things.&quot; 9:6)
&apos;Umar added &quot;So this property was especially given to Allah&apos;s Apostle, but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah&apos;s Apostle used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Allah &apos;s Cause. Allah &apos;s Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?&quot; They replies in the affirmative. &apos;Umar then said to &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas. &quot;I ask you by Allah, do you know this?&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, &apos;Abu Bakr said, &apos;I am the successor of Allah&apos;s Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr&apos;s successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. &apos;Ah and &apos;Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, &apos;Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your nephew&apos;s property, and this man, i.e. &apos;Ali, came to me asking for his wife&apos;s share from her father&apos;s property. I told you both that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Our (prophets&apos;) properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).&apos; When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, &apos;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah&apos;s Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.&apos; So, both of you said (to me), &apos;Hand it over to us,&apos; and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?&quot; The group aid, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then &apos;Umar faced &apos;Ali and Abbas saying, &quot;I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes. &quot; He said, &quot; Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf.&quot;</text>

I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released me. I followed &apos;Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), &quot;What is wrong with the people (fleeing)?&quot; He replied, &quot;This is the Will of Allah,&quot; After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, &quot;Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils.&quot; I got up and said, &quot;Who will be a witness for me?&quot; and then sat down. The Prophet again said, &quot;Anyone who has killed an enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.&quot; I (again) got up and said, &quot;Who will be a witness for me?&quot; and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;O Abu Qatada! What is your story?&quot; Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So please compensate him on my behalf.&quot; On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &quot;No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah&apos;s Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah&apos;s Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.&quot; So, Allah&apos;s Apostle gave the spoils to me.

The head stands for Khosrau, and one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to go towards Khosrau.&quot; So, &apos;Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Numan bin Muqrin as our commander.

While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths, Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:-- &quot;Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e. martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master.&quot; (Al-Mughira, then blamed An-Numan for delaying the attack and) An-Nu&apos; man said to Al-Mughira, &quot;If you had participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah&apos;s Apostle he would not have blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Allah&apos;s Apostle in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after midday).&quot;</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;While I was at the House in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel. When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, &apos;Open the gate.&apos; The gatekeeper asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; He said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; The gate-keeper,&apos; Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; The gate-keeper said, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&apos; Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, &apos;You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was said, &apos;Who is with you?&apos; He said, &apos;Muhammad&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been sent for?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; It was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&quot; Then I met Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, &apos;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is with you? Gabriel said, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been sent for?&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; said Gabriel. &apos;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&apos; (The Prophet added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, &apos;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet!&apos; Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.&apos; Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met and greeted Aaron who said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet&quot;. Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, &apos;You are welcomed O brother and. a Prophet.&apos; When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, &apos;O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.&apos; Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Abraham who said, &apos;You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.&apos; Then I was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma&apos;mur (i.e. Allah&apos;s House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).&apos; Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, &apos;The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos; Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, &apos;What have you done?&apos; I said, &apos;Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.&apos; He said, &apos;I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.&apos; I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again, he said, &apos;What have you done?&apos; I said, &apos;Allah has made it five only.&apos; He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah&apos;s Final Order)&apos;&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle was addressed by Allah, &quot;I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn Abbas:
The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&apos;ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael&apos;s mother followed him saying, &quot;O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?&quot; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, &quot;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; She said, &quot;Then He will not neglect us,&quot; and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka&apos;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:
&apos;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&apos; (14.37) Ishmael&apos;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).
When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.&quot;
The Prophet said, &quot;This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &apos;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&quot; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&quot;
The Prophet added, &quot;May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael&apos;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&quot; The Prophet further added, &quot;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &apos;Don&apos;t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.&apos; The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&apos;. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, &apos;This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&apos; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Ishmael&apos;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &apos;Do you allow us to stay with you?&quot; She replied, &apos;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&apos; They agreed to that.&quot; The Prophet further said, &quot;Ishmael&apos;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.
After Ishmael&apos;s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael&apos;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&apos;s wife about him, she replied, &apos;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&apos; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, &apos;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&apos; complaining to him. He said, &apos;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&apos; When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &apos;Has anyone visited you?&apos; She replied, &apos;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.&apos; On that Ishmael said, &apos;Did he advise you anything?&apos; She replied, &apos;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.&apos; Ishmael said, &apos;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&apos; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).
Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&apos;s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &apos;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&apos; Abraham asked her, &apos;How are you getting on?&apos; asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, &apos;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&apos; Then she thanked Allah&apos; Abraham said, &apos;What kind of food do you eat?&apos; She said. &apos;Meat.&apos; He said, &apos;What do you drink?&apos; She said, &apos;Water.&quot; He said, &quot;O Allah! Bless their meat and water.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&quot; The Prophet added,&quot; Then Abraham said Ishmael&apos;s wife, &quot;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&apos; When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, &apos;Did anyone call on you?&apos; She replied, &apos;Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,&apos; so she praised him and added. &apos;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&apos; Ishmael asked her, &apos;Did he give you any piece of advice?&apos; She said, &apos;Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&apos; On that Ishmael said, &apos;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.&apos;
Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &apos;O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&apos; Ishmael said, &apos;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&apos; Abraham asked, &apos;Will you help me?&apos; Ishmael said, &apos;I will help you.&apos; Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&apos; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka&apos;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &apos;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&apos; The Prophet added, &quot;Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka&apos;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&quot; (2.127)</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn Abbas:
When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&apos;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away. They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&apos;s mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&apos;s mother followed him, and when they reached Kada&apos;, she called him from behind, &apos;O Abraham! To whom are you leaving us?&apos; He replied, &apos;(I am leaving you) to Allah&apos;s (Care).&apos; She said, &apos;I am satisfied to be with Allah.&apos; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to herself, &apos;I&apos;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&apos; She ascended the Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &apos;i&apos;d better go and see the state of the child,&apos; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &apos;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&apos; She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), &apos;I&apos;d better go back and see the state of the child.&apos; But suddenly she heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &apos;Help us if you can offer any help.&apos; Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn &apos;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out. Ishmael&apos;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet) said, &quot;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&quot;) Ishmael&apos;s mother started drinking from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them, and they said, &apos;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&apos; They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &apos;O ishmael&apos;s mother! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)?&apos; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &apos;I want to call on my dependents I left (at Mecca).&apos; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&apos;s wife) and said, &apos;Where is Ishmael?&apos; She replied, &apos;He has gone out hunting.&apos; Abraham said (to her), &apos;When he comes, tell him to change the threshold of his gate.&apos; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael said to her, &apos;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&apos; Again Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&apos;s house and asked. &quot;Where is Ishmael?&quot; Ishmael&apos;s wife replied, &quot;He has gone out hunting,&quot; and added, &quot;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&apos; Abraham asked, &apos;What is your food and what is your drink?&apos; She replied, &apos;Our food is meat and our drink is water.&apos; He said, &apos;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&quot; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) said, &quot;Because of Abraham&apos;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&quot; Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending his arrows. He said, &quot;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for Him.&quot; Ishmael said, &quot;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&quot; Abraham said, &quot;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&quot; Ishmael said, &quot;Then I will do.&quot; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&apos;ba) while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &quot;O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&quot; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &apos;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&quot; (2.127)</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn Umar:
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Once three persons (from the previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each other, &apos;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&apos;s Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining Allah&apos;s Pleasure).&apos; So one of them said, &apos;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &apos;Go to those cows and drive them away.&apos; He said to me, &apos;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&apos; I said to him, &apos;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&apos; So he drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the rock.&apos; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &apos;O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&apos; So the rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &apos;O Allah! You know that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&apos;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &apos;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. &apos;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they came out (of the cave).&quot; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it is a kind of disbelief.)</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn Abbas:
When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu Dhar, he said to his brother, &quot;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven. Listen to him and then come to me.&quot; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &quot;I have seen him exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&quot; Abu Dhar said, &quot;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&quot; So, he took his journey-food and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &apos;Ali saw him and realized that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &apos;Ali again passed by him and said, &quot;Hasn&apos;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&quot; So, &apos;Ali let him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about anything, till it was the third day when &apos;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu Dhar again stayed with him. &apos;Ali then asked, &quot;Won&apos;t you tell me what has brought you here?&quot; He replied, &quot;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will guide me, then I will tell you.&quot; When &apos;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his purpose). &apos;Ali said, &quot;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&quot; Abu Dhur agreed and followed &apos;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very spot. The Prophet said to him, &quot;Go back to your people and inform them (of this religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&quot; Abu Dhur said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. infidels).&quot; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as possible, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&quot; The people then got up and beat him till they knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to you! Don&apos;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&quot; Thus he saved him from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and Al-&apos;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before).</text>

Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in the Mosque. Then &apos;Ali passed by me and said, &apos;It seems you are a stranger?&apos; I said, &apos;Yes.&apos; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him.

I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.&apos; &apos;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &apos;You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.&apos; &apos;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &apos;Present (the principles of) Islam to me.&apos; When he did, I embraced Islam &apos;immediately. He said to me, &apos;O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. &apos; I said, &apos;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&apos; Abu Dhar went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &apos;O folk of Quraish ! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah&apos;s Slave and His Apostle.&apos; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &apos;Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&apos; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &apos;Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &apos;Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar?&apos; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &apos;Get at this Sabi!&apos; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.&apos; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to Islam.&quot;</text>

That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr. Allah&apos;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself. &apos;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&apos;s head and started saying: Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while) he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &quot;O so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am Junub,&quot; Alllah&apos;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man then offered the prayer. Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him. We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her, &quot;Where can we get water?&quot; She replied, &quot;Oh ! There is no water.&quot; We asked, &quot;how far is your house from the water?&quot; She replied, &quot;A distance of a day and a night travel.&quot; We said, &quot;Come on to Allah&apos;s Apostle, &quot;She asked, &quot;What is Allah&apos;s Apostle ?&quot; So we brought her to Allah&apos;s Apostle against her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The Prophet then said, &quot;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&quot; So some dates and pieces of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &quot;I have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&quot; So Allah guided the people of that village through that lady.

      <text>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:
While we were with Allah&apos;s Apostle who was distributing (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Do Justice.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Woe to you! Who could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&apos;an but it does not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an arrow goes through a victim&apos;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&apos;s blade, would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&apos;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely. Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&quot; I testify that I heard this narration from Allah&apos;s Apostle and I testify that &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him.</text>

I relate the traditions of Allah&apos;s Apostle to you for I would rather fall from the sky than attribute something to him falsely. But when I tell you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying, &quot;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&apos;an) and they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;</text>

We complained to Allah&apos;s Apostle (of the persecution inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka&apos;ba, leaning over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, &quot;Would you seek help for us? Would you pray to Allah for us?&quot; He said, &quot;Among the nations before you a (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty.</text>

Umaiya said to Sad, &quot;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&apos;ba?&quot; So, while Sad was going around the Ka&apos;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &quot;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&quot; Sad replied, &quot;I am Sad.&quot; Abu Jahl said, &quot;Are you circumambulating the Ka&apos;ba safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&quot; Sad said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &quot;Don&apos;t shout at Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&quot; Sad then said (to Abu Jahl). &apos;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba, I will spoil your trade with Sham.&quot; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &quot;Don&apos;t raise your voice.&quot; and kept on taking hold of him.

I saw &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and &apos;Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, &quot;What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &apos;Iraq) than it can bear?&quot; They replied, &quot;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&quot; &apos;Umar again said, &quot;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&quot; They said, &quot;No, (we haven&apos;t).&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&quot; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &apos;Abbas. Whenever Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, &quot;Stand in straight lines.&quot;
When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&apos;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &quot;The dog has killed or eaten me,&quot; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &apos;Umar held the hand of &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.
Those who were standing by the side of &apos;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &apos;Umar and they were saying, &quot;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&quot; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &apos;Umar said, &quot;O Ibn &apos;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &quot;The slave of Al Mughira.&quot; On that &apos;Umar said, &quot;The craftsman?&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&quot; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &apos;Abbas said to &apos;Umar. &quot;If you wish, we will do.&quot; He meant, &quot;If you wish we will kill them.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;You are mistaken (for you can&apos;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&quot;
Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &quot;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&quot; Some said, &quot;We are afraid (that he will die).&quot; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &quot;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&apos;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&quot;
When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &apos;Umar said, &quot;Call the young man back to me.&quot; (When he came back) &apos;Umar said, &quot;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&quot; &apos;Umar further said, &quot;O &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&quot; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &apos;Umar said, &quot;If the property of &apos;Umar&apos;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &apos;Adi bin Ka&apos;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&quot;
&apos;Umar then said (to &apos;Abdullah), &quot;Go to &apos;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &quot;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&apos;t say: &apos;The chief of the believers,&apos; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &quot;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&quot; Abdullah greeted &apos;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &quot;&apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&quot; She said, &quot;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&quot; When he returned it was said (to &apos;Umar), &quot;&apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar has come.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Make me sit up.&quot; Somebody supported him against his body and &apos;Umar asked (&apos;Abdullah), &quot;What news do you have?&quot; He said, &quot;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &apos;Aisha and say: &quot;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&quot;
Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &apos;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &apos;Umar), &quot;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&quot; Umar said, &quot;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&apos;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&quot; Then &apos;Umar mentioned &apos;Ali, &apos;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &apos;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &quot;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.
I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &apos;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &apos;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&apos;s and His Apostle&apos;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&quot; So when &apos;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar greeted (&apos;Aisha) and said, &quot;&apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&quot; &apos;Aisha said, &quot;Bring him in.&quot; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.
When he was buried, the group (recommended by &apos;Umar) held a meeting. Then &apos;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&quot; Az-Zubair said, &quot;I give up my right to Ali.&quot; Talha said, &quot;I give up my right to &apos;Uthman,&quot; Sad, &apos;I give up my right to &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin &apos;Auf.&quot; &apos;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &apos;Uthman and &apos;Ali), &quot;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&quot; So both the sheiks (i.e. &apos;Uthman and &apos;Ali) kept silent. &apos;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So &apos;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &apos;Ali) and said, &quot;You are related to Allah&apos;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &apos;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&quot; Then he took the other (i.e. &apos;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &apos;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &quot;O &apos;Uthman! Raise your hand.&quot; So he (i.e. &apos;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &apos;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &apos;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&quot; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&apos;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag.

The Prophet then gave him the flag. &apos;Ali said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&quot;</text>

She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&apos;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&apos;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&apos; By Allah!

The (Hashimi) laborer set out with the Quraishi driving his camels. There passed by him another man from Banu Hashim.

The employer asked the laborer, &quot;Why, from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?&quot; He replied, &quot;There is no fetter for it.&quot; The Quraishi asked, &quot;Where is its fetter?&quot; and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death (later on Just before his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The laborer asked (him), &quot;Will you go for the pilgrimage?&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I will attend it.&quot; The (Hashimi) laborer said, &quot;Will you please convey a message for me once in your life?&quot; The other man said, &quot;yes.&quot; The laborer wrote: &apos;When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you, call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter.&quot; Then the laborer expired. When the employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, &quot;What has happened to our companion?&quot; He said, &quot;He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died) and I buried him.&quot; Then Abu Talib said, &quot;The deceased deserved this from you.&quot; After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, &quot;O the family of Quraish!&quot; The people replied, &quot;This is Quraish.&quot; Then he called, &quot;O the family of Banu Hashim!&quot; Again the people replied, &quot;This is Banu Hashim.&quot; He asked, &quot;Who is Abu Talib?&quot; The people replied, &quot;This is Abu Talib.&quot; He said, &quot;&apos;So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel).&quot; Then Abu Talib went to the (Quraishi) killer and said to him, &quot;Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas.&quot; The killer went to his people and they said, &quot;We will take an oath.&quot; Then a woman from Banu Hashim who was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him, came to Abu Talib and said, &quot;O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the oath-taking is carried on.&quot; Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came (to Abu Talib) and said, &quot;O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him. Then 48 men came and took the oath. Ibn &apos;Abbas further said:) By Him in Whose Hand my life is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons remained alive.</text>

Allah caused the day of Buath to take place before Allah&apos;s Apostle was sent (as an Apostle) so that when Allah&apos;s Apostle reached Medina, those people had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So Allah made that day precede Allah&apos;s Apostle so that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace Islam.
Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas: To run along the valley between two green pillars of Safa and Marwa (mountains) was not Sunna, but the people in the pre-islamic period of ignorance used to run along it, and used to say: &quot;We do not cross this rain stream except running strongly. &quot;</text>

A saw might be put over the parting of his head which would be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his religion. Allah will surely complete this religion (i.e. Islam) so that a traveler from Sana to Hadra-maut will not be afraid of anybody except Allah.&quot; (The sub-narrator, Baiyan added, &quot;Or the wolf, lest it should harm his sheep.&quot;)</text>

So I asked Ibn &apos;Abbas who said, &quot;When the Verse that is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, &apos;But we have slain such life as Allah has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Allah, and we have also committed fornication.&apos; So Allah revealed:-- &apos;Except those who repent, believe, and do good-- (25.70)
So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire forever.&quot; Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, &quot;Except the one who regrets (one&apos;s crime) . &quot;</text>

When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the Prophet he said to his brother, &quot;Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me.&quot; So his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. &quot;I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry.&quot; Abu Dhar said, &quot;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&quot; He then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, &apos;Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw &apos;Ali, he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. &apos;Ali passed by him and said, &quot;Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?&quot; So &apos;Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. &apos;Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then &apos;Ali said &quot;Will you tell me what has brought you here?&quot; Abu Dhar said, &quot;If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you.&quot; &apos;Ali promised him, and he informed &apos;Ali about the matter. &apos;Ali said, &quot;It is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter.&quot; Abu Dhar did so, and followed &apos;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some of the Prophet&apos;s talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, &quot;Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.&quot; Abu Dhar said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans).&quot; So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, &quot;I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&quot; The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), &quot;Woe to you! Don&apos;t you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sha&apos;m is through their way?&quot; So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him).</text>

When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and Ibn &apos;Abu Yaghuth and talked to both of them of what I had said to &apos;Uthman and what he had said to me. They said, &apos;You have done your duty.&apos; So while I was sitting with them. &apos;Uthman&apos;s Messenger came to me. They said, &apos;Allah has put you to trial.&quot; I set out and when I reached &apos;Uthman, he said, &apos;What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?&apos; I recited Tashahhud and added, &apos;Allah has sent Muhammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Quran) to him. You (O Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and had faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina), and you enjoyed the company of Allah&apos;s Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin &apos;Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on him the legal punishment.&apos; &apos;Uthman then said to me, &apos;O my nephew! Did you ever meet Allah&apos;s Apostle ?&apos; I said, &apos;No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the virgin in her seclusion.&apos; &apos;Uthman then recited Tashahhud and said, &apos;No doubt, Allah has sent Muhammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Quran) and I was amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and I had faith in Muhammad&apos;s Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&apos;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah, I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then Allah made Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then &apos;Umar became Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?&apos; I replied in the affirmative. &apos;Uthman further said, &apos;The what are these talks which are reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin &apos;Uqb; Allah willing, I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged fort lashes.

Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&quot; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &quot;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&quot; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &quot;The animal&apos;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&apos;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.
When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has Muhammad been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &apos;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven.

Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos; The gate was opened.
When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and &apos;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&apos; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened.

Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened.

Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked. &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&apos; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&apos; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &apos;What makes you weep?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&apos; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Gabriel.&apos; It was asked,&apos; Who is accompanying you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Muhammad.&apos; It was asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &apos;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&apos;
So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &apos;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&apos; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &apos;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&apos; Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &apos;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &apos;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&apos; He replied,&apos; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&apos;
Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&apos;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &apos;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&apos; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &apos;What have you been ordered to do?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&apos; burden.&apos; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.
When I came back to Moses, he said, &apos;What have you been ordered?&apos; I replied, &apos;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&apos; He said, &apos;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&apos;s burden.&apos; I said, &apos;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&apos;s Order.&apos; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &apos;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.&quot;</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle added, &quot;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is. sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don&apos;t remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah&apos;s Apostle in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.&quot;
So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. &quot;A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?&quot; So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina&apos;s protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, &quot;Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house.
Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, &quot;We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (&quot;O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the &apos;Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.&quot;
At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, &quot;In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.&quot; So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah&apos;s Apostle said to him, &quot;Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah&apos;s Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months.
One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr&apos;s house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, &quot;This is Allah&apos;s Apostle with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. &quot;Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;i have been given permission to migrate.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle replied, &quot;(I will accept it) with payment.&quot; So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr&apos;s daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts).
Then Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. &apos;Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-&apos;As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.
The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju&apos;sham said that his father informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju&apos;sham saying, &quot;The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and said, &quot;O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.&quot; Suraqa added, &quot;I too realized that it must have been they. But I said &apos;No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.&apos; I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me.
Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by Allah&apos;s Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Allah&apos;s Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, &quot;Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head.&quot; Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, &quot;Do not tell others about us.&quot; Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered &apos;Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah&apos;s Apostle proceeded on his way.
Narrated &apos;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah&apos;s Apostle met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah&apos;s Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage.
The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, &quot;O you &apos;Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!&quot; So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah&apos;s Apostle on the summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani &apos;Amr bin &apos;Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah&apos;s Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah&apos;s Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah&apos;s Apostle. Allah&apos;s Apostle stayed with Bani &apos;Amr bin &apos;Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah&apos;s Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah&apos;s Apostle at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of &apos;Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, &quot;No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying &quot;This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.&quot; He was also saying, &quot;O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.&quot; Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me.
(Ibn Shibab said, &quot;In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah&apos;s Apostle
recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.&quot;)</text>

      <text>Narrated Anas bin Malik:
Allah&apos;s Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while Allah&apos;s Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?&quot; Abu Bakr would say, &quot;This man shows me the Way,&quot; One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider persuing them. He said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! This is a horse-rider persuing us.&quot; The Prophet looked behind and said, &quot;O Allah! Cause him to fall down.&quot; So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Prophet! Order me whatever you want.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.&quot; So, in the first part of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah&apos;s Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah&apos;s Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Allah&apos;s Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they said, &quot;Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah&apos;s Prophet had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying &quot;Allah&apos;s Prophet has come! Allah&apos;s Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family members of Abu Aiyub, &apos;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to Allah&apos;s Prophet and then went home.
Then Allah&apos;s Prophet said, &quot;Which is the nearest of the houses of our Kith and kin?&quot; Abu Aiyub replied, &quot;Mine, O Allah&apos;s Prophet! This is my house and this is my gate.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Go and prepare a place for our midday rest.&quot; Abu Aiyub said, &quot;Get up (both of you) with Allah&apos;s Blessings.&quot; So when Allah&apos;s Prophet went into the house, &apos;Abdullah bin Salaim came and said &quot;I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that you have come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam, for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered. Allah&apos;s Apostle said to them, &quot;O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam.&quot; The Jews replied, &quot;We do not know this.&quot; So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then he said, &quot;What sort of a man is &apos;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&quot; They said, &quot;He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of the most learned amongst us.&quot; He said, &quot;What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot; What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot;What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot;O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them.&quot; He came out and said, &quot;O (the group of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for certain that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!&apos; They said, &quot;You tell a lie.&quot; On that Allah&apos;s Apostle turned them out.</text>

When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina reached &apos;Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, He said, &quot;I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;Gabriel has just now informed me of that.&quot; Ibn Salam said, &quot;He (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The Prophet said, &quot;As for the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to the West. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man&apos;s discharge proceeds the woman&apos;s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman&apos;s discharge proceeds the man&apos;s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman.&quot;
On this, &apos;Abdullah bin Salam said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah.&quot; and added, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to I slam . &quot; The Jews came, and the Prophet said, &quot;What kind of man is &apos;Abdullah bin Salam among you?&quot; They replied, &quot;The best of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us. &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;What would you think if &apos;Abdullah bin Salam should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;May Allah protect him from that.&quot; The Prophet repeated his question and they gave the same answer. Then &apos;Abdullah came out to them and said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah!&quot; On this, the Jews said, &quot;He is the most wicked among us and the son of the most wicked among us.&quot; So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. &apos;Abdullah bin Salam) said, &quot;It is this that I was afraid of, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Abdullah bin Mas&apos;ud:
From Sad bin Mu&apos;adh: Sad bin Mu&apos;adh was an intimate friend of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad, and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Allah&apos;s Apostle arrived at Medina, Sa&apos;d went to perform &apos;Umra and stayed at Umaiya&apos;s home in Mecca. He said to Umaiya, &quot;Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to perform Tawaf around the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met them and said, &quot;O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?&quot; He said, &quot;He is Sad.&quot; Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, &quot;I see you wandering about safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be able to go your family safely.&quot; Sad, raising his voice, said to him, &quot;By Allah, if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through Medina.&quot; On this, Umaiya said to him, &quot;O Sad do not raise your voice before Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca).&quot; Sad said, &quot;O Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah&apos;s Apostle predicting that the Muslim will kill you.&quot; Umaiya asked, &quot;In Mecca?&quot; Sad said, &quot;I do not know.&quot; Umaiya was greatly scared by that news.
When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife, &quot;O Um Safwan! Don&apos;t you know what Sad told me? &quot;She said, &quot;What has he told you?&quot; He replied, &quot;He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions that they will kill me. I asked him, &apos;In Mecca?&apos; He replied, &apos;I do not know.&quot; Then Umaiya added, &quot;By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.&quot; But when the day of (the Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, &quot;Go and protect your caravan.&quot; But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said, &quot;O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.&quot; Abu Jahl kept on urging him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, &quot;As you have forced me to change my mind, by Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). &quot;O Um Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).&quot; She said to him, &quot;O Abu Safwan! Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&quot; He said, &quot;No, but I do not want to go with them but for a short distance.&quot; So when Umaiya went out, he used to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Allah caused him to be killed at Badr.</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
Allah&apos;s Apostle sent out ten spies under the command of &apos;Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari, the grand-father of &apos;Asim bin &apos;Umar Al-Khattab. When they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between &apos;Usfan and Mecca, their presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent about one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, &quot;These dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&quot; and went on tracing the Muslims&apos; footsteps. When &apos;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them and said, &quot;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&quot; &apos;Asim bin Thabit said, &quot;O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&quot; So the archers threw their arrows at them and martyred &apos;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. The third man said, &quot;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with you for I follow the example of these.&quot; He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of the Badr battle.
The sons of Al-Harit bin &apos;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin &apos;Amr on the day (of the battle) of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, &quot;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&quot; Later on (while narrating the story) she said, &quot;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca.&quot; She used to say,&quot; It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.&quot;
When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, Khubaib requested them. &quot;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer.&quot; They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, &quot;By Allah! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.&quot; Then he (invoked evil upon them) saying, &quot;O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and do not leave anyone of them&quot;&apos; Then he recited: &quot;As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&apos;s Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&quot; Then Abu Sarva, &apos;Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &apos;Asim bin Thabit&apos;s death, sent some messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of &apos;Asim, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not cut anything from his body.</text>

      <text>Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri:
That once &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, &quot;Will you admit &apos;Uthman, &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your permission?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Yes, let them come in.&quot; After a while, Yarfa- came again and said, &quot;Will you admit &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas who are asking your permission?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So, when the two entered, &apos;Abbas said, &quot;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &apos;Ali). &quot;Both of them had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas started reproaching each other. The (present) people (i.e. &apos;Uthman and his companions) said, &quot;O chief of the believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;We (Prophets) our properties are not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,&apos; and he said it about himself?&quot; They (i.e. &apos;Uthman and his company) said, &quot;He did say it. &quot;&apos;Umar then turned towards &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas and said, &quot;I beseech you both, by Allah! Do you know that Allah&apos;s Apostle said this?&quot; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &quot;Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else. Allah said:--
&quot;And what Allah gave to His Apostle (&quot;Fai&quot;&quot; Booty) from them--For which you made no expedition With either Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And Allah is able to do all things.&quot; (59.6)
So this property was especially granted to Allah&apos;s Apostle . But by Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of it. And from this Allah&apos;s Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&apos;s Property is spent (i.e. in charity), Allah&apos;s Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and Abu Bakr said, &apos;I am the successor of Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do, and all of you (at that time) knew all about it.&quot; Then &apos;Umar turned towards &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas and said, &quot;You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, &apos;I am the successor of Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&apos; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa as Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere, pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you (i.e. &apos;Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O &apos;Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&apos; Then when I thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or else you should not speak to me (about it).&apos; So, both of you said to me, &apos;Hand it over to us on this condition.&apos; And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision) till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf.&quot; The sub-narrator said, &quot;I told &apos;Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, &apos;Malik bin Aus has told the truth&quot; I heard &apos;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, &apos;The wives of the Prophet sent &apos;Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don&apos;t you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added: &apos;The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.&apos; So, this property (of Sadaqa) was in the hands of Ali who withheld it from &apos;Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the hands of Hasan bin &apos;Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin &apos;Ali, and then in the hands of Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn, then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah&apos;s Apostle .&quot;</text>

Would you like that I kill him?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes,&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &quot;Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab). &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;You may say it.&quot; Then Muhammad bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &quot;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e. Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from you.&quot; On that, Kab said, &quot;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &quot;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or two of food.&quot; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab said, &quot;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&quot; Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &quot;What do you want?&quot; Ka&apos;b replied, &quot;Mortgage your women to me.&quot; They said, &quot;How can we mortgage our women to you and you are the most handsome of the &apos;Arabs?&quot; Ka&apos;b said, &quot;Then mortgage your sons to me.&quot; They said, &quot;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would be abused by the people&apos;s saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He came to Kab at night along with Kab&apos;s foster brother, Abu Na&apos;ila. Kab invited them to come into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &quot;Where are you going at this time?&quot; Kab replied, &quot;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster) brother Abu Na&apos;ila have come.&quot; His wife said, &quot;I hear a voice as if dropping blood is from him, Ka&apos;b said. &quot;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if invited to be killed.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators mention the men as &apos;Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &quot;When Ka&apos;b comes, I will touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him. I will let you smell his head.&quot; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &quot; have never smelt a better scent than this. Ka&apos;b replied. &quot;I have got the best &apos;Arab women who know how to use the high class of perfume.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka&apos;b &quot;Will you allow me to smell your head?&quot; Ka&apos;b said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Muhammad smelt it and made his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka&apos;b again, &quot;Will you let me (smell your head)?&quot; Ka&apos;b said, &quot;Yes.&quot; When Muhammad got a strong hold of him, he said (to his companions), &quot;Get at him!&quot; So they killed him and went to the Prophet and informed him.

Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.&quot; Abu Safyan said, &quot;Superior may be Hubal!&quot; On that the Prophet said (to his companions), &quot;Reply to him.&quot; They asked, &quot;What may we say?&quot; He said, &quot;Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!&quot; Abu Sufyan said, &quot;We have (the idol) Al-&apos;Uzza, whereas you have no &apos;Uzza!&quot; The Prophet said (to his companions), &quot;Reply to him.&quot; They said, &quot;What may we say?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&quot; Abu Sufyan said, &quot;(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.&quot; Narrated Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as martyrs.</text>

When we wrote the Holy Quran, I missed one of the Verses of Surat-al-Ahzab which I used to hear Allah&apos;s Apostle reciting. Then we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. The Verse was:--
&apos;Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they have been Killed in Allah&apos;s Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting&quot; (33.23) So we wrote this in its place in the Quran.</text>

      <text>Narrated Jafar bin &apos;Amr bin Umaiya:
I went out with &apos;Ubaidullah bin &apos;Adi Al-Khaiyar. When we reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), &apos;Ubaidullah bin &apos;Adi said (to me), &quot;Would you like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to us, &quot;He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.&quot; So we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he greeted us in return. &apos;Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except his eyes and feet. &apos;Ubaidullah said, &quot;O Wahshi! Do you know me?&quot; Wahshi looked at him and then said, &quot;No, by Allah! But I know that &apos;Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child&apos;s feet.&quot; Then &apos;Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), &quot;Will you tell us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?&quot; Wahshi replied &quot;Yes, Hamza killed Tuaima bin &apos;Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut&apos;im said to me, &apos;If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free.&quot; When the people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of &apos;Ainain ..&apos;Ainain is a mountain near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba&apos; came out and said, &apos;Is there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?&apos; Hamza bin &apos;Abdul Muttalib came out and said, &apos;O Siba&apos;. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge Allah and His Apostle?&apos; Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah&apos;s Apostle, I was told that the Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah&apos;s Apostle. When he saw me, he said, &apos;Are you Wahshi?&apos; I said, &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;Was it you who killed Hamza?&apos; I replied, &apos;What happened is what you have been told of.&apos; He said, &apos;Can you hide your face from me?&apos; So I went out when Allah&apos;s Apostle died, and Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, &apos;I will go out to Musailamah so that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him, driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders, and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar said, &apos;A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed &apos;Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of &apos;Asim bin &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set out, and when they reached (a place) between &apos;Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. &apos;Asim and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey food from Medina.
The archers said, &quot;These are the dates of Medina,&quot; and followed their traces till they took them over. When &apos;Asim and his companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers encircled them and said, &quot;You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to us, we will not kill anyone of you.&quot; &apos;Asim said, &quot;As for me, I will never come down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.&quot; So they fought with them till they killed &apos;Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows, and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The third man who was with them said, &quot;This is the first breach in the covenant,&quot; and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin &apos;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &apos;Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, &quot;I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh.
When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said &apos;Are you afraid that I will kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,&apos; &quot; Later on she used to say, &quot;I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.&quot; So they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, &quot;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer.&quot; Then he went to them and said, &quot;Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time.&quot; So it was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He then said, &quot;O Allah! Count them one by one,&quot; and added, &apos;When I am being martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&apos;s Sake, because this death is in Allah&apos;s Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.&quot; Then &apos;Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some people to &apos;Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for &apos;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who could not harm his body consequently.</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah&apos;s Apostle used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah&apos;s Apostle after Allah&apos;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah&apos;s Apostle had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned.
When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone.
Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited Istirja&apos; (i.e. &quot;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&apos;un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&apos;. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk (i.e. slander) more, was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&quot;
(Urwa said, &quot;The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. &apos;Abdullah&apos;s) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.&quot; Urwa also added, &quot;None was mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (&apos;Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but they were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&quot; Urwa added, &quot;&apos;Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she used to say, &apos;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father&apos;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&apos;s honor from you.&quot;).
&apos;Aisha added, &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah&apos;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah&apos;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&apos; How is that (lady)?&apos; and leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&apos; where we used to answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &apos;Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin &apos;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin &apos;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &apos;Let Mistah be ruined!&apos; I said, &apos;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&apos; On that she said, &apos;O you Hantah! Didn&apos;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &apos;I said, &apos;What did he say?&apos;
Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting me, said, &apos;How is that (lady)?&apos; I said, &apos;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&apos; as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&apos;s Apostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, &apos;O mother! What are the people talking about?&apos; She said, &apos;O my daughter! Don&apos;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would find faults with her.&apos; I said, &apos;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really talking in this way?&apos; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed.
Allah&apos;s Apostle called &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, &apos;(O Allah&apos;s Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&apos; &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&apos; On that Allah&apos;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &apos;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&apos; Barira said to him, &apos;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&apos;
So, on that day, Allah&apos;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and complained about &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &apos;O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&apos; Sad bin Mu&apos;adh the brother of Banu &apos;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.&apos; On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&apos;adh). &apos;By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.&apos;
On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu&apos;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &apos;Ubada, &apos;By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.&apos; On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah&apos;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&apos;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing, and I could never sleep.
In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah&apos;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &apos;Amma Badu, O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&apos;
When Allah&apos;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, &apos;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&apos; My father said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle .&apos; Then I said to my mother, &apos;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &apos;By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&apos;s father when he said, &apos;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&apos; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&apos;s Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&apos;s Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle.
So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of Allah&apos;s Apostle was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, &apos;O &apos;Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!&apos; Then my Mother said to me, &apos;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&apos;s Apostle). I replied, &apos;By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:-- &quot;Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............&quot; (24.11-20)
Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, &apos;By Allah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.&apos; Then Allah revealed:--
&quot;And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&apos;s cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&quot; (24.22)
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &apos;Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.&apos; and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, &apos;By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at all.&apos;
Aisha further said:.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, &apos;What do you know and what did you see?&quot; She replied, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I refrain from claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about &apos;Aisha).&apos; From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, &apos;Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.&apos; Later on the man was martyred in Allah&apos;s Cause.&quot;</text>

At that time the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&apos;s Apostle near the Tree, and &apos;Umar was not aware of that. So Abdullah (bin Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the horse and brought it to &apos;Umar. While &apos;Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for fighting, &apos;Abdullah informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&apos;s Apostle beneath the Tree. So &apos;Umar set out and &apos;Abdullah accompanied him till he gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&apos;s Apostle, and it was this event that made people say that Ibn &apos;Umar had embraced Islam before &apos;Umar. &quot;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar added, &quot;The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at him.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;O &apos;Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah&apos;s Apostle and looking at him.&quot; &apos;Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge o allegiance to the Prophet.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah&apos;s Apostle had left of the property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr said, &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.&apos; By Allah, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah&apos;s Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Allah&apos;s Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do.&quot; So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband &apos;Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect &apos;Ali much, but after her death, &apos;Ali noticed a change in the people&apos;s attitude towards him. So Ali sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. &apos;Ali had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet&apos;s death and Fatima&apos;s death). &apos;Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, &quot;Come to us, but let nobody come with you,&quot; as he disliked that &apos;Umar should come, &apos;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &quot;No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone &quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;What do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them&apos; So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then &apos;Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), &quot;We know well your superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah&apos;s Apostle .&quot;
Thereupon Abu Bakr&apos;s eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Allah&apos;s Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Allah&apos;s Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow.&quot; On that &apos;Ali said to Abu Bakr, &quot;I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon.&quot; So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of &apos;Ali and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then &apos;Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr&apos;s right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. &apos;Ali added, &quot;But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry.&quot; On that all the Muslims became happy and said, &quot;You have done the right thing.&quot; The Muslims then became friendly with &apos;Ali as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).</text>

When the Prophet went out for the &apos;Umra in the month of Dhal-Qa&apos;da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote: &quot;This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded.&quot;
The infidels said (to the Prophet), &quot;We do not agree with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of &apos;Abdullah.&quot; Then he said to &apos;Ali, &quot;Erase (the name of) &apos;Apostle of Allah&apos;.&quot; &apos;Ali said, &quot;No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name).&quot; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle took the writing sheet...and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got it the following written! &quot;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of &apos;Abdullah, has concluded: &quot;Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he should not forbid him.&quot;
(In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said &quot;Tell your companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished.&quot; So the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting &quot;O Uncle, O Uncle!&quot; Ali took her by the hand and said to Fatima, &quot;Take the daughter of your uncle.&quot; So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) &apos;Ali, Zaid and Ja&apos;far quarreled about her. &apos;Ali said, &quot;I took her for she is the daughter of my uncle.&quot; Ja&apos;far said, &quot;She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my wife.&quot; Zaid said, &quot;She is the daughter of my brother.&quot; On that, the Prophet gave her to her aunt and said, &quot;The aunt is of the same status as the mother.&quot; He then said to &apos;Ali, &quot;You are from me, and I am from you,&quot; and said to Ja&apos;far, &quot;You resemble me in appearance and character,&quot; and said to Zaid, &quot;You are our brother and our freed slave.&quot; &apos;Ali said to the Prophet &apos;Won&apos;t you marry the daughter of Hamza?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;She is the daughter of my foster brother.&quot;</text>

When Allah&apos;s Apostle set out (towards Mecca) during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) and this news reached (the infidels of Quraish), Abu Sufyan, Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqa came out to gather information about Allah&apos;s Apostle , They proceeded on their way till they reached a place called Marr-az-Zahran (which is near Mecca). Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of Arafat. Abu Sufyan said, &quot;What is this? It looked like the fires of Arafat.&quot; Budail bin Warqa&apos; said, &quot;Banu &apos;Amr are less in number than that.&quot; Some of the guards of Allah&apos;s Apostle saw them and took them over, caught them and brought them to Allah&apos;s Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam.
When the Prophet proceeded, he said to Al-Abbas, &quot;Keep Abu Sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the Muslims. So Al-&apos;Abbas kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes with the Prophet started passing in front of Abu Sufyan in military batches. A batch passed and Abu Sufyan said, &quot;O &apos;Abbas Who are these?&quot; &apos;Abbas said, &quot;They are (Banu) Ghifar.&quot; Abu Sufyan said, I have got nothing to do with Ghifar.&quot; Then (a batch of the tribe of) Juhaina passed by and he said similarly as above. Then (a batch of the tribe of) Sad bin Huzaim passed by and he said similarly as above. then (Banu) Sulaim passed by and he said similarly as above. Then came a batch, the like of which Abu Sufyan had not seen. He said, &quot;Who are these?&quot; Abbas said, &quot;They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada, the one holding the flag.&quot; Sad bin Ubada said, &quot;O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka&apos;ba will be permissible.&quot; Abu Sufyan said., &quot;O &apos;Abbas! How excellent the day of destruction is! &quot;Then came another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair bin Al Awwam. When Allah&apos;s Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the Prophet), &quot;Do you know what Sad bin &apos;Ubada said?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;What did he say?&quot; Abu Sufyan said, &quot;He said so-and-so.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Sad told a lie, but today Allah will give superiority to the Ka&apos;ba and today the Ka&apos;ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered that his flag be fixed at Al-Hajun.

Did Allah&apos;s Apostle order you to fix the flag here?&apos; &quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka&apos;da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.

Some of them replied, &quot;We are ordered to praise Allah and repent to Him if we are helped and granted victory.&quot; Some said, &quot;We do not know.&quot; Others kept quiet. &apos;Umar then said to me, &quot;Do you say similarly?&quot; I said, &quot;No.&quot; &apos;Umar said &quot;What do you say then?&quot; I said, &quot;This Verse indicates the approaching of the death of Allah&apos;s Apostle of which Allah informed him.

We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people, and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, &quot;What is wrong with the people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, &quot;That man claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&quot; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the &apos;Arabs (other than Quraish) delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.&quot; &quot;Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &quot;By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet for sure!&quot; The Prophet afterwards said to them, &apos;Offer such-and-such prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows Qur&apos;an most should, lead the prayer.&quot; So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more Qur&apos;an than I because of the Quranic material which I used to learn from the caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, &quot;Won&apos;t you cover the anus of your reciter for us?&quot; So they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a shirt for me.

Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, &quot;Who will be my witness?&quot; and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?&quot; So I narrated the whole story; A man said, &quot;Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;No!

The Muslims (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with them. Suddenly I met &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, &quot;What is wrong with the people?&quot; He said, &quot;It is the order of Allah&quot; Then the people returned to Allah&apos;s Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the killed man.&quot; So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah&apos;s Apostle. A man from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, &quot;The arms of the deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate him for it (i.e. the spoils),&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;No, Allah&apos;s Apostle will not give it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah&apos;s Lions who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle then got up and gave that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got after embracing Islam.</text>

Jarir said &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle said to me, &quot;Won&apos;t you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, (I will relieve you).&quot; So I proceeded along with one-hundred and fifty cavalry from Ahmas tribe who were skillful in riding horses. I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet of that, and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he said, O Allah! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).&apos; Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in Yemen belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka&apos;ba.&quot; Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &quot;The messenger of Allah&apos;s Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your neck.&quot; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped there and said to him, &quot;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&quot; So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till it was like a scabby camel.&quot; Then the Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times.</text>

That Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn Abbas told him that Ibn Abbas, &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama sent him to &apos;Aisha saying, &quot;Pay her our greetings and ask her about our offering of the two-Rak&apos;at after &apos;Asr Prayer, and tell her that we have been informed that you offer these two Rakat while we have heard that the Prophet had forbidden their offering.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;I and &apos;Umar used to beat the people for their offering them.&quot; Kuraib added, &quot;I entered upon her and delivered their message to her.&apos; She said, &apos;Ask Um Salama.&apos; So, I informed them (of &apos;Aisha&apos;s answer) and they sent me to Um Salama for the same purpose as they sent me to &apos;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &apos;I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the &apos;Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet ) offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, &apos;Stand beside him and say (to him): Um Salama says, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Didn&apos;t I hear you forbidding the offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?&apos; And if he beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.&apos; So the lady slave did that and the Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished his prayer, he said, &apos;O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me about these two Rakat after the &apos;Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of &apos;Abdul Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me offering) make up for those.&quot;</text>

The Prophet sent some cavalry towards Najd and they brought a man from the tribe of Banu Hanifa who was called Thumama bin Uthal. They fastened him to one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet went to him and said, &quot;What have you got, O Thumama?&quot; He replied,&quot; I have got a good thought, O Muhammad! If you should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then ask me whatever wealth you want.&quot; He was left till the next day when the Prophet said to him, &quot;What have you got, Thumama? He said, &quot;What I told you, i.e. if you set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.&quot; The Prophet left him till the day after, when he said, &quot;What have you got, O Thumama?&quot; He said, &quot;I have got what I told you. &quot;On that the Prophet said, &quot;Release Thumama.&quot; So he (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and then entered the Mosque and said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the &apos;Umra. And now what do you think?&quot; The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him to perform the &apos;Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, &quot;You have become a Sabian?&quot; Thumama replied, &quot;No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad, Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica unless the Prophet gives his permission.&quot;</text>

Musailima Al-Kadhdhab came during the lifetime of the Prophet and started saying, &quot;If Muhammad gives me the rule after him, I will follow him.&quot; And he came to Medina with a great number of the people of his tribe. Allah&apos;s Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time, Allah&apos;s Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet ) stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him, &quot;If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah&apos;s Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my behalf.&quot; Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah&apos;s Apostle : &quot;You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,&quot; and Abu Huraira informed me that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;When I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik:
Who, from among Kab&apos;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which he failed to take part. Kab said, &quot;I did not remain behind Allah&apos;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&apos;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&apos;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&apos;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&apos;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa.
By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&apos;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&apos;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&quot; Ka&apos;b added, &quot;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&apos;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &apos;I can do that.&apos; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&apos;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&apos; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything.
Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&apos;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused. Allah&apos;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &apos;What did Ka&apos;b do?&apos; A man from Banu Salama said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&apos; Then Mu&apos;adh bin Jabal said, &apos;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&apos; Allah&apos;s Apostle kept silent.&quot; Ka&apos;b bin Malik added, &quot;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &apos;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&apos; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&apos;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah&apos;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&apos;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&apos;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &apos;Come on.&apos; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &apos;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&apos; I answered, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse.
By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&apos;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&apos; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&apos; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &apos;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&apos;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&apos;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&apos; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &apos;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&apos; They replied, &apos;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&apos; I said, &apos;Who are they?&apos; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&apos; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&apos;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.
We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&apos;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &apos;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&apos; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&apos; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&quot; Ka&apos;b added, &quot;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &apos;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&apos; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:
&quot;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&quot;
When I read it, I said to myself, &apos;This is also a sort of a test.&apos; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&apos;s Apostle and said, &apos;Allah&apos;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&apos; I said, &apos;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&apos; He said, &apos;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&apos; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &apos;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&quot; Kab added, &quot;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &apos; He said, &apos;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&apos;
On that, some of my family members said to me, &apos;Will you also ask Allah&apos;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&apos; I said, &apos;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&apos;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&apos;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&apos; Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&apos;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&apos; calling with his loudest voice, &apos;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&apos; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&apos;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&apos;s Apostle.
The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&apos;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &apos;We congratulate you on Allah&apos;s Acceptance of your repentance.&quot; Kab further said, &quot;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&apos;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&quot; Kab added, &quot;When I greeted Allah&apos;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &quot;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&quot; Kab added, &quot;I said to the Prophet &apos;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&apos; He said, &apos;No, it is from Allah.&apos; Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&apos; I said, &apos;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&apos; and added, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&apos;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:--
&quot;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&quot; (9.117-119)
By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&apos;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- &quot;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people--&quot; (9.95-96) Kab added, &quot;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&apos;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&apos;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&quot; (9.118)
What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</text>

Ibn Abbas said, &quot;When Allah&apos;s Apostle was on his deathbed and there were some men in the house, he said, &apos;Come near, I will write for you something after which you will not go astray.&apos; Some of them ( i.e. his companions) said, &apos;Allah&apos;s Apostle is seriously ill and you have the (Holy) Quran. Allah&apos;s Book is sufficient for us.&apos; So the people in the house differed and started disputing. Some of them said, &apos;Give him writing material so that he may write for you something after which you will not go astray.&apos; while the others said the other way round. So when their talk and differences increased, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Get up.&quot; Ibn Abbas used to say, &quot;No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah&apos;s Apostle was prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh on a horse. He dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon &apos;Aisha and went straight to Allah&apos;s Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet&apos;s face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come upon you.&quot;
Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas: Abu Bakr went out while Umar bin Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, &quot;Sit down, O &apos;Umar!&quot; But &apos;Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said, &quot;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad , then Muhammad is dead, but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die. Allah said:--&quot;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )......Allah will reward to those who are thankful.&quot; (3.144) By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then).
Narrated Az-Zuhri: Said bin Al-Musaiyab told me that &apos;Umar said, &quot;By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had died.&quot;</text>

And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&apos;an.&quot; Abu Bakr added, &quot;I said to &apos;Umar, &apos;How can I do something which Allah&apos;s Apostle has not done?&apos; &apos;Umar said (to me), &apos;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&apos; So &apos;Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as &apos;Umar.&quot; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &quot;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&apos;s Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur&apos;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &quot; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&apos;an. I said to both of them, &quot;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):--
&quot;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&quot; (9.128)
The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with &apos;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar&apos;s daughter.</text>

Don&apos;t you see what condition we have reached?&apos; Adam will say, &apos;Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.&apos; So they will go to Noah and say (to him), &apos;O Noah! You are the first (of Allah&apos;s Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Allah has named you a thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; He will say.&apos; Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.&apos; They will go to Abraham and say, &apos;O Abraham! You are Allah&apos;s Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; He will say to them, &apos;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. I had told three lies (Abu Haiyan (the sub-narrator) mentioned them in the Hadith) Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Moses.&apos; The people will then go to Moses and say, &apos;O Moses! You art Allah&apos;s Apostle and Allah gave you superiority above the others with this message and with His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for us with your Lord Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; Moses will say, &apos;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will become thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.&apos; So they will go to Jesus and say, &apos;O Jesus! You are Allah&apos;s Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&apos; Jesus will say. &apos;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, &apos;Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.&apos; So they will come to me and say, &apos;O Muhammad ! You are Allah&apos;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&apos;t you see in what state we are?&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Then I will go beneath Allah&apos;s Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.&apos; So I will raise my head and Say, &apos;My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord&apos;. It will be said, &apos;O Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people.&quot; The Prophet further said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham).&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Aisha:
(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&apos;s Apostle after Allah&apos;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&apos;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&apos;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &quot;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&quot; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &quot;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&quot; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&apos;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&apos;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &quot;How is that (lady)?&quot; and then depart.
That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &apos;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &quot;Let Mistah be ruined ! &quot; I said to her, &quot;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&apos; She said, &quot;O you there! Didn&apos;t you hear what he has said?&quot; I said, &quot;And what did he say?&quot; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &quot;How is that (lady)?&quot; I said, &quot;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&quot; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&apos;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &quot;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&quot; My mother said, &quot;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&quot; I said, &quot;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&quot;
That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&apos;s Apostle called &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&apos;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&quot; But &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&quot; &apos;Aisha added: So Allah&apos;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &quot;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &quot;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&apos;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &quot;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&quot; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&quot; On that, Sad bin &apos;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &quot;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&quot; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &apos;Ubada, &quot;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&quot; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&apos;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&apos;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&apos;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &quot;Thereafter, O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&apos;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&quot; When Allah&apos;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &quot;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&quot; He said, &quot;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Then I said to my mother, &quot;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot;
She said, &quot;I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &quot;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&apos;s father: &quot;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&apos;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&apos;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &quot;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&quot; My mother said to me, &quot;Get up and go to him.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&quot; So Allah revealed: &quot;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....&quot; (24.11-20).
When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter&apos;s kinship to him and his poverty, said, &quot;By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha&quot;. So Allah revealed:
&quot;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&apos;s Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.&quot; (24.22)
Abu Bakr said, &quot;Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.&quot; So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, &quot;By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.&quot; Aisha further said: Allah&apos;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, &quot;O Zainab! What have you seen?&quot; She replied, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&quot; Of all the wives of Allah&apos;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</text>

      <text>Narrated Aisha:
When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah&apos;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&quot; Sad bin Mu&apos;adh got up and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off&quot; Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu&apos;adh), &quot;You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.&quot; It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, &quot;Let Mistah. be ruined&quot; I said to her, &quot;O mother Why do you abuse your Son&quot; On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, &quot;Let Mistah be ruined&quot; I said to her, &quot;Why do you abuse your son?&quot; She stumbled for the third time and said, &quot;Let Mistah be ruined&quot; whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, &quot;By Allah, I do not abuse him except because of you.&quot; I asked her, &quot;Concerning what of my affairs?&quot; So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, &quot;Has this really happened?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes, by Allah.&quot; I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Allah&apos;s Apostle &quot;Send me to my father&apos;s house.&quot; So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, &quot;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&quot; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &quot;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&quot; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &quot;Does my father know about it?&quot; She said, &quot;yes&quot; I asked, Does Allah&apos;s Apostle know about it too?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes, Allah&apos;s Apostle does too.&quot; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &quot;What is the matter with her? &quot; She said, &quot;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&quot; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &quot;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&quot; I went back to my home and Allah&apos;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &quot;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&quot; On that, some of the Prophet&apos;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &quot;Tell the truth to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &quot;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.&quot; Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, &quot;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&quot; Later that man was martyred in Allah&apos;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, &quot;Now then O &apos;Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&quot; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &quot;Isn&apos;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&apos;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &quot;What should I say?&quot; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &quot;What should I say?&quot; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &quot;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&quot; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &quot;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &apos;She has confessed herself guilty.&quot; By Allah, &apos;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&apos;s name but couldn&apos;t) Joseph&apos;s father when he said; So (for me) &quot;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&apos; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &quot;Have the good tidings O &apos; &quot;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&quot; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &quot;Get up and go to him.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&quot; (Aisha used to say:) &quot;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&apos;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:--
&quot;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot; (24.22)
On that, Abu Bakr said, &quot;Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.&quot; So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</text>

While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, &quot;Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.&quot; That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas&apos;ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, &quot;He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, &apos;Allah knows best,&apos; for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, &apos;I do not know,&apos; if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. &apos;Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&apos;an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)&apos; (38.86)
The Qur&apos;aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, &apos;O Allah! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.&apos; So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, &quot;O Muhammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).&apos; Then Ibn Mas&apos;ud recited:-- &apos;Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible....but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)
Ibn Mas&apos;ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them thus): &apos;On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.&apos; (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah&apos;s saying- &quot;Lizama&quot; (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah&apos;s Statement:

The Prophet replied, &quot;The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents.

A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured.

I looked up towards the sky, and behold! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the Cave of Hira&apos;, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was so terrified by him that I fell down on the ground. Then I went to my wife and said, &apos;Wrap me in garments! Wrap me in garments!&apos; They wrapped me, and then Allah revealed:
&quot;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn...and desert the idols.&quot; (74.1-5) Abu Salama said....Rujz means idols.&quot; After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.</text>

When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Allah&apos;s Apostle , he (Allah&apos;s Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Allah revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins:
&apos;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection...&apos; (75) the Verses:--
&apos;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Quran) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn Abbas added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur&apos;an) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, &quot;When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it,&quot; means, &apos;It is for us to explain it through your tongue.&apos; So whenever Gabriel came to Allah&apos;s Apostle &apos; he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Allah promised him.</text>

&apos;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&apos;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &quot;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&apos;. The Prophet said, &quot;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&quot; &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;Gabriel?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&quot; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:--
&quot;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&apos;an) down to your heart by Allah&apos;s permission.&quot; (2.97) Then he added, &quot;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&apos;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&apos;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&quot; On hearing that, &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&apos;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&quot; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &quot;What is &apos;Abdullah&apos;s status amongst you?&quot; They replied, &quot;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;What would you think if &apos;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&quot; They replied, &quot;May Allah protect him from this!&quot; Then &apos;Abdullah came out and said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&quot; The Jews then said, &quot;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&quot; and disparaged him.

      <text>Narrated Ibn Abbas:
Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying, &quot;I set out during the Truce that had been concluded between me and Allah&apos;s Apostle. While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, &apos;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&apos; The people replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &apos;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&apos; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &apos;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&apos;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&apos; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &apos;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s) family status amongst you? I said, &apos;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&quot; Heraclius said, &apos;Was any of his ancestors a king?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&apos; I said, &apos;It is the poor who followed him.&apos; He said, &apos;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&apos; I said, &apos;The are increasing.&apos; He said, &apos;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Did you fight with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;How was your fighting with him?&apos; I said, &apos;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&apos; He said, &apos;Did he ever betray?&apos; I said, &apos;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &apos;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &apos;No.&apos; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &apos;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&quot; Abu Safyan said, &quot;Heraclius then asked me, &apos;What does he order you to do?&apos; I said, &apos;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&apos; Then Heraclius said, &apos;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&apos; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:
&quot;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine........ Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah&apos;s Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah&apos;s Statement):--&quot;O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Allah....bear witness that we are Muslims.&apos; (3.64)
When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;While coming out, I said to my companions, &apos;The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.&apos; So I continued to believe that Allah&apos;s Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace Islam.&quot; Az-Zuhri said, &quot;Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, &apos;O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?&apos; (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, &apos;Bring them back to me.&apos; So he called them and said, &apos;I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.&apos; Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.&quot; (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</text>

      <text>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
Allah&apos;s Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, &quot;Do not cover us with dust.&quot; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&apos;an. On that, &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, &quot;O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him.&quot; On that &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.&quot;
So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, &quot;Did you not hear what &apos;Abu Hub-b said?&quot; He meant &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai. &quot;He said so-and-so.&quot; On that Sad bin Ubada said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Allah said: &quot;And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans........&apos;(3.186) And Allah also said:--&quot;Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..&quot; (2.109)
So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah&apos;s Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, &quot;This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).&quot; So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah&apos;s Apostle and became Muslims.</text>

Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet&apos;s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), &quot;Umar has come to me and said: &quot;Casualties were heavy among the Qurra&apos; of the! Qur&apos;an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra&apos; on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur&apos;an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur&apos;an be collected.&quot; I said to &apos;Umar, &quot;How can you do something which Allah&apos;s Apostle did not do?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;By Allah, that is a good project. &quot;Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which &apos;Umar had realized.&quot; Then Abu Bakr said (to me). &apos;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&apos;s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur&apos;an and collect it in one book).&quot; By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&apos;an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, &quot;How will you do something which Allah&apos;s Apostle did not do?&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;By Allah, it is a good project.&quot; Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &apos;Umar. So I started looking for the Qur&apos;an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:
&apos;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa&apos; (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur&apos;an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with &apos;Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of &apos;Umar.</text>

I heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying, &quot;There will appear some people among you whose prayer will make you look down upon yours, and whose fasting will make you look down upon yours, but they will recite the Qur&apos;an which will not exceed their throats (they will not act on it) and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the game whereupon the archer would examine the arrowhead but see nothing, and look at the unfeathered arrow but see nothing, and look at the arrow feathers but see nothing, and finally he suspects to find something in the lower part of the arrow.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas :
I had been eager to ask &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said &apos;If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till &apos;Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &apos;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when &apos;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &quot;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &apos;If you two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?&quot; (66.4) He said, &quot;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &apos;Aisha and Hafsa.&quot; Then &apos;Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, &quot;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &apos;Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the night.&apos; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &apos;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&apos; Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &apos;Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?&apos; She said, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;You are a ruined losing person! Don&apos;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&apos;s Apostle and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., &apos;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet .&quot; Umar added,&quot;At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said, &apos;Today a great thing has happened.&apos; I asked, &apos;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?&apos; He said, &apos;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah&apos;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &apos;Umar added, &quot;The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said &quot;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&apos; I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &apos;What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&apos; She said, &apos;I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&apos; I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, &apos;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for &apos;Umar (to enter)?&apos; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying, &apos;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&apos; Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave, &apos;Will you get the permission for &apos;Umar?&apos; He went in and returned saying, &apos;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&apos; So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &apos;Will you get the permission for &apos;Umar?&apos; He went in and returned to me saying, &apos;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&apos; When I was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &apos;The Prophet has given you permission.&apos; Then I entered upon Allah&apos;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&apos; He looked at me and said, &apos;No.&apos; I said, &apos;Allah Akbar!&apos; And then, while still standing, I said chatting, &apos;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&apos;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were overpowered by their women.&apos; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &apos;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&apos;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &quot;Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&apos;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&apos; &quot; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Allah.&apos; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &apos;Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.&apos; I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.&apos; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to &apos;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &apos;I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,&apos; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon &apos;Aisha. &apos;Aisha said to him, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one.&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&apos; &apos;Aisha added, &apos;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him.&apos; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what &apos;Aisha had said . &quot; (1) The Prophet, &apos; had decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one month. See Quran: (66.4)</text>

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
(the wife of the Prophet) When believing women came to the Prophet as emigrants, he used to test them in accordance with the order of Allah. &apos;O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them . . .&apos; (60.10) So if anyone of those believing women accepted the above mentioned conditions, she accepted the conditions of faith. When they agreed on those conditions and confessed that with their tongues, Allah&apos;s Apostle would say to them, &quot;Go, I have accepted your oath of allegiance (for Islam). By Allah, and hand of Allah&apos;s Apostle never touched the hand of any woman, but he only used to take their pledge of allegiance orally. By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle did not take the pledge of allegiance of the women except in accordance with what Allah had ordered him. When he accepted their pledge of allegiance he would say to them, &quot;I have accepted your oath of allegiance.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn Juraij:
Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl bin Sad, the brother of Bani Sa&apos;idi He said, &quot;An Ansari man came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?&apos; So Allah revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Quran about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, &apos;Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.&apos; So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet .&quot; Ibn Shihab added, &quot;After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother&apos;s name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him.&quot; Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As&apos;Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above narration), &quot;If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth.&quot; Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).</text>

Then a man from his tribe came to him, complaining that he had found a man width his wife. &apos;Asim said, &apos;I have not been put to task except for my statement (about Lian).&apos; &apos;Asim took the man to the Prophet and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife. The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, &apos;O Allah!

The Prophet then made them carry out Lian.&quot; Then a man from that gathering asked Ibn &apos;Abbas, &quot;Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, &apos;If I were to stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady&apos;?&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;No, that was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. &quot;</text>

Zainab bint Abu Salama told me these three narrations: Zainab said: I went to Um Habiba, the wife of the Prophet when her father, Abu- Sufyan bin Herb had died. Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume which contained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls with it and then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, &quot;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying, &apos;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&apos; &quot; Zainab further said: I want to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died. She asked for perfume and used some of it and said, &quot;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying on the pulpit, &apos;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the last day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&apos; &quot; Zainab further said, &quot;I heard my mother, Um Salama saying that a woman came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease, can she apply kohl to her eye?&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle replied, &quot;No,&quot; twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, &quot;No.&quot; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle added, &quot;It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed.&quot; I said to Zainab, &quot;What does &apos;throwing a globe of dung when one year had elapsed&apos; mean?&quot; Zainab said, &quot;When a lady was bereaved of her husband, she would live in a wretched small room and put on the worst clothes she had and would not touch any scent till one year had elapsed. Then she would bring an animal, e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her body against it. The animal against which she would rub her body would scarcely survive. Only then she would come out of her room, whereupon she would be given a globe of dung which she would throw away and then she would use the scent she liked or the like.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Bakra:
The Prophet said, &quot;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&apos;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&apos;da (ath-thamj and Sha&apos;ban. The Prophet then asked, &quot;Which month is this?&quot; We said, &quot;Allah and his Apostle know better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&quot; We said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Which town is this?&quot; We said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &quot;isn&apos;t it the town (of Mecca)?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;What day is today?&quot; We replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it the day of Nahr?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He then said, &quot;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&quot; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &quot;No doubt!

      <text>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya velvet covering. He mounted me behind him and went to visit Sad bin &apos;Ubada, and that had been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded till he passed by a gathering in which &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that had been before &apos;Abdullah embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews. &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the donkey covered the gathering, &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and said, &quot;Do not trouble us with dust.&quot; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them some verses of the Holy Qur&apos;an. On that, &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &quot;O man ! There is nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.&quot; On that &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our gathering, for we love that.&quot; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &quot;O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e., &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&quot; Sad said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town (Medina decided unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his head, but when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&apos;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way you have seen.&quot;</text>

So the people started talking about the issue and said, &quot;It is we who have believed in Allah and followed His Apostle; therefore those people are either ourselves or our children who are born m the Islamic era, for we were born in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&apos;&apos; When the Prophet heard of that, he came out and said. &quot;Those people are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya, nor do they believe in bad or good omen (from birds etc.) nor do they get themselves branded (Cauterized). but they put their trust (only) in their Lord &quot; On that &apos;Ukasha bin Muhsin said. &quot;Am I one of them, O Allah&apos;s Apostle?&apos; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then another person got up and said, &quot;Am I one of them?&quot; The Prophet said, &apos;Ukasha has anticipated you.&quot;</text>

One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &quot;(They were) &apos;Aisha and Hafsa.&quot; Then he added, &quot;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &apos;Strange! You can retort in this way?&apos; She said, &apos;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&apos;s Apostle?&apos; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &apos;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&apos; I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &apos;O &apos;Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah&apos;s Apostle and his wives.&apos; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah&apos;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah&apos;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah&apos;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &apos;A great event has happened!&apos; I asked him, &apos;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&apos; He said, &apos;Greater than that! Allah&apos;s Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, &quot;Ask the permission for me to enter.&quot; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&apos;s Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&quot; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</text>

Act justly.&quot; The Prophets said, &quot;Woe to you! Who else would act justly if I did not act justly?&quot; &apos;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &quot;Allow me to chop his neck off.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;No, for he has companions (who are apparently so pious that) if anyone of (you compares his prayer with) their prayer, he will consider his prayer inferior to theirs, and similarly his fasting inferior to theirs, but they will desert Islam (go out of religion) as an arrow goes through the victim&apos;s body (games etc.) in which case if its Nasl is examined nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Nady is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, and if its Qudhadh is examined, nothing will be seen thereon, for the arrow has gone out too fast even for the excretions and blood to smear over it.

&apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab set out with Allah&apos;s Apostle, and a group of his companions to Ibn Saiyad. They found him playing with the boys in the fort or near the Hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad was nearing his puberty at that time, and he did not notice the arrival of the Prophet till Allah&apos;s Apostle stroked him on the back with his hand and said, &quot;Do you testify that I am Allah&apos;s Apostle?&quot; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &quot;I testify that you are the Apostle of the unlettered ones (illiterates)&quot;.

When Allah&apos;s Apostle entered the garden, he started hiding behind the trunks of the date-palms intending to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was Lying on his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his mumur were heard. Ibn Saiyad&apos;s mother saw the Prophet and said, &quot;O Saf (the nickname of Ibn Saiyad)!

The Prophet said, &quot;If his mother had kept quiet, then I would have learnt more about him.&quot; &apos;Abdullah added: Allah&apos;s Apostle stood up before the people (delivering a sermon), and after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserved, he mentioned the Ad-Dajjal saying, &quot;I warn you against him, and there has been no prophet but warned his followers against him. Noah warned his followers against him but I am telling you about him, something which no prophet has told his people of, and that is: Know that he is blind in one eye where as Allah is not so.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
That Allah&apos;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &apos;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha.
When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &quot;Do not cover us with dust.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&apos;an. On that &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &quot;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&quot; On that &apos;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&quot; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&apos;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&apos;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;O Sa&apos;d! Didn&apos;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&quot; (meaning &apos;Abdullah bin Unbar). &quot;He said so-and-so.&quot; Sa&apos;d bin Ubada said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&apos;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.
So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &apos;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186)
He also said: &apos;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. .... (2.109) So Allah&apos;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&apos;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &quot;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&apos;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&quot;. Then they became Muslims.</text>

If you should die then (after reciting this) you will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so let these words be the last you say (before going to bed)&quot; While I was memorizing it, I said, &quot;Wa birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle whom You have sent).&apos; The Prophet said, &quot;No, but say: Wa binabiyyi-kalladhi arsalta (in Your Prophet whom You have sent).&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Huraira:
By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet and h is companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah&apos;s Book and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then Umar passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah&apos;s Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet ) passed by me and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, &quot;O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!&quot; I replied, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said to me, &quot;Follow me.&quot; He left and I followed him.
Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, &quot;From where is this milk?&quot; They said, &quot;It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such woman).&quot; He said, &quot;O Aba Hirr!&quot; I said, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;Go and call the people of Suffa to me.&quot; These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet , he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order off the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, &quot;How will this little milk be enough for the people of As-Suffa?&quot; thought I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself, but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet&apos;s permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house.
The Prophet said, &quot;O Aba-Hirr!&quot; I said, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;Take it and give it to them.&quot; So I took the bowl (of Milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. &quot;O Aba Hirr!&quot; I replied, &quot;Labbaik, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;There remain you and I.&quot; I said, &quot;You have said the truth, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;Sit down and drink.&quot; I sat down and drank. He said, &quot;Drink,&quot; and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, &quot;No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach).&quot; He said, &quot;Hand it over to me.&quot; When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah&apos;s Name on it and drank the remaining milk.</text>

Once a daughter of Allah&apos;s Apostle sent a message to Allah&apos;s Apostle while Usama, Sa&apos;d, and my father or Ubai were (sitting there) with him. She said, (in the message); My child is going to die; please come to us.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle returned the messenger and told him to convey his greetings to her, and say, &quot;Whatever Allah takes, is for Him and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world): so she should be patient and hope for Allah&apos;s reward.&quot; Then she again sent for him swearing that he should come; so The Prophet got up, and so did we.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Imran:
Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &apos;Auf said that Abu Raja&apos; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &apos;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &quot;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&quot; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &quot;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am Junub and there is no water. &quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&quot;
Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &apos;Auf added that Abu Raja&apos; had named him but he had forgotten) and &apos;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &quot;Where can we find water?&quot; She replied, &quot;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&quot; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &quot;Where?&quot; They said, &quot;To Allah&apos;s Apostle .&quot; She said, &quot;Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, the same person. So come along.&quot; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &quot;Help her to dismount.&quot; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&apos;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &quot;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&quot; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &quot;O so and so what has delayed you?&quot; She said, &quot;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi&apos; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&apos;s true Apostle.&quot;
Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &quot;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&quot; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.
Abu &apos;Abdultah said: The word Saba&apos;a means &quot;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&quot; Abul &apos;Ailya said, &quot;The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&quot;</text>

The Quraish people became very worried about the Makhzumiya lady who had committed theft. They said, &quot;Nobody can speak (in favor of the lady) to Allah&apos;s Apostle and nobody dares do that except Usama who is the favorite of Allah&apos;s Apostle. &quot; When Usama spoke to Allah&apos;s Apostle about that matter, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Do you intercede (with me) to violate one of the legal punishment of Allah?&quot; Then he got up and addressed the people, saying, &quot;O people! The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad committed theft, Muhammad will cut off her hand.!&quot;</text>

Some people from the tribe of &apos;Ukl came to the Prophet and embraced Islam.

They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy) they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and legs should not be cauterized, till they die.</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas:
I used to teach (the Qur&apos;an to) some people of the Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &apos;Abdur Rahman bin &apos;Auf. While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &apos;Umar&apos;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, &quot;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of the Believers (&apos;Umar), saying, &apos;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about so-and-so who says, &apos;If &apos;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&apos; &apos;Umar became angry and then said, &apos;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&quot;
&apos;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;I said, &apos;O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophet&apos;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&apos; On that, &apos;Umar said, &apos;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver before the people in Medina.&quot;
Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa&apos;id bin Zaid bin &apos;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a short while &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to Said bin Zaid bin &apos;Amr bin Nufail &quot;Today &apos;Umar will say such a thing as he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph.&quot; Said denied my statement with astonishment and said, &quot;What thing do you expect &apos;Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?&quot;
In the meantime, &apos;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &apos;Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;Now then, I am going to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&apos;s Apostle did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him.
I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, &apos;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&apos;s Book,&apos; and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&apos;s Book: &apos;O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.&apos; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah&apos;s Slave and His Apostles.&apos; (O people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, &apos;By Allah, if &apos;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.&apos; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed.
And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. &apos;Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, &apos;Let&apos;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, &apos;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you going?&apos; We replied, &apos;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; They said to us, &apos;You shouldn&apos;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&apos; I said, &apos;By Allah, we will go to them.&apos; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &apos;Who is that man?&apos; They said, &apos;He is Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada.&apos; I asked, &apos;What is wrong with him?&apos; They said, &apos;He is sick.&apos; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&apos;s speaker said, &apos;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&apos; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &apos;To proceed, we are Allah&apos;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&apos;
When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &apos;Wait a while.&apos; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, &apos;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&apos;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&apos;t feel at present.&apos;
And then one of the Ansar said, &apos;I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you.&apos;
Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &apos;O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.&apos; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa&apos;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the Ansar said, &apos;You have killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; I replied, &apos;Allah has killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; Umar added, &quot;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Abu Qilaba:
Once &apos;Umar bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz sat on his throne in the courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him. Then he admitted them and (when they came in), he said, &quot;What do you think of Al-Qasama?&quot; They said, &quot;We say that it is lawful to depend on Al-Qasama in Qisas, as the previous Muslim Caliphs carried out Qisas depending on it.&quot; Then he said to me, &quot;O Abu Qilaba! What do you say about it?&quot; He let me appear before the people and I said, &quot;O Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs. If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&quot; He replied, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&quot; Then the people said, &quot;Didn&apos;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&apos;s Apostle cut off the hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&quot; I said, &quot;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &quot;Eight persons from the tribe of &apos;Ukl came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and complained about that to Allah&apos;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &quot;Won&apos;t you go out with the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&apos; milk and urine (as medicine)?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So they went out and drank the camels&apos; milk and urine, and after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&apos;s Apostle and took away all the camels. This news reached Allah&apos;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them in the sun till they died.&quot; I said, &quot;What can be worse than what those people did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&quot;
Then &apos;Anbasa bin Said said, &quot;By Allah, I never heard a narration like this of today.&quot; I said, &quot;O &apos;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&quot; &apos;Anbasa said, &quot;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is among them.&quot; I added, &quot;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by Allah&apos;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to Allah&apos;s Apostle and said to him, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle, we have found our companion who had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle went out and asked them, &quot;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed him?&quot; They said, &quot;We think that the Jews have killed him.&quot; The Prophet sent for the Jews and asked them, &quot;Did you kill this (person)?&quot; They replied, &quot;No.&quot; He asked the Al-Ansars, &quot;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an oath that they have not killed him?&quot; They said, &quot;It matters little for the Jews to kill us all and then take false oaths.&quot; He said, &quot;Then would you like to receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your man)?&quot; They said, &quot;We will not take the oath.&quot; Then the Prophet himself paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&quot; The narrator added, &quot;The tribe of Hudhail repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.
Then, at a place called Al-Batha&apos; (near Mecca), the man attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured the Yemenite and brought him to &apos;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &quot;He has killed our companion.&quot; The Yemenite said, &quot;But these people had repudiated him (i.e., their companion).&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had not repudiated him.&quot; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &quot;We and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year and then died.&quot; I further said, &quot;&apos;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in Sham.&quot;</text>

Who would be just if I were not?&quot; &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &quot;Allow me to cut off his neck ! &quot; The Prophet said, &quot; Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game&apos;s body in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined, nothing will be found on it.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Aisha:
The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&apos;s Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &quot;I do not know how to read.&quot; (The Prophet added), &quot;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read,&quot; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&quot; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &quot;Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous...up to..... ..that which he knew not.&quot; (96.15)
Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &quot;Cover me! Cover me!&quot; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &quot;O Khadija, what is wrong with me?&quot; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &apos;I fear that something may happen to me.&quot; Khadija said, &apos;Never! But have the glad tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&quot; Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&apos;s brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &quot;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.&quot; Waraqa asked, &quot;O my nephew! What have you seen?&quot; The Prophet described whatever he had seen.
Waraqa said, &quot;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle asked, &quot;Will they turn me out?&quot; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: &quot;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, &quot;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&apos;s Apostle in truth&quot; whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &apos;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &apos;He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&apos; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night).</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, &quot;Did anyone of you see a dream?&quot; So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, &quot;Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, &apos;Proceed!&apos; I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&apos;s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, &apos;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&apos; They said, &apos;Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man&apos;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man&apos;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &apos;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&apos; They said to me, &apos;Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&quot; I think the Prophet said, &quot;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, &apos;Who are these?&apos; They said to me, &apos;Proceed!&apos; And so we proceeded and came across a river.&quot; I think he said, &quot;.... red like blood.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, &apos;Who are these (two) persons?&apos; They replied, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &apos;Who is this (man)?&apos; They said to me, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &apos;Who is this?&apos; They replied, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &apos;Go up and I went up&apos; The Prophet added, &quot;So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.&quot; The Prophet further added, &quot;My two companions (angels) said to me, &apos;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&apos; I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &apos;That (palace) is your place.&apos; I said to them, &apos;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&apos; They replied, &apos;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to them, &apos;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&apos; They replied, &apos;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).&quot; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;And also the children of pagans.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;My two companions added, &apos;The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.&apos;&quot;</text>

Allah&apos;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&apos;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&apos;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&apos;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &quot;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&apos;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &apos;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&apos; and later it will be said about some man, &apos;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&apos; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&quot; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</text>

Therefore I consider it advisable that you (Abu Bakr) should have the Qur&apos;an collected.&apos; I said, &apos;How dare I do something which Allah&apos;s Apostle did not do?&apos; &apos;Umar said, By Allah, it is something beneficial.&apos; &apos;Umar kept on pressing me for that till Allah opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chest of &apos;Umar and I had in that matter, the same opinion as &apos;Umar had.&quot; Abu Bakr then said to me (Zaid), &quot;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&apos;s Apostle. So you should search for the fragmentary scripts of the Quran and collect it (in one Book).&quot; Zaid further said: By Allah, if Abu Bakr had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one place to another it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&apos;an. Then I said (to &apos;Umar and Abu Bakr), &quot;How can you do something which Allah&apos;s Apostle did not do?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;By Allah, it is something beneficial.&quot; Zaid added: So he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Allah opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &apos;Umar, and I had in that matter, the same opinion as theirs.
So I started compiling the Quran by collecting it from the leafless stalks of the date-palm tree and from the pieces of leather and hides and from the stones, and from the chests of men (who had memorized the Quran). I found the last verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: (&quot;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves--&apos; (9.128-129) ) from Khuzaima or Abi Khuzaima and I added to it the rest of the Sura.

      <text>Narrated Abu Dhar:
Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; Gabriel answered: &apos;Gabriel.&apos; He asked, &apos;Is there anyone with you?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;Yes, Muhammad I is with me.&apos; He asked, &apos;Has he been called?&apos; Gabriel said, &apos;Yes.&apos; So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; He replied, &apos;He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.&apos;
Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, &apos;Open (the gate).&apos; The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: &quot;Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, &quot;When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; The Prophet asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Idris.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;I passed by Moses and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Moses.&apos; Then I passed by Jesus and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.&apos; I asked, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Jesus.
Then I passed by Abraham and he said, &apos;Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.&apos; I asked Gabriel, &apos;Who is he?&apos; Gabriel replied, &apos;He is Abraham. The Prophet added, &apos;Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens.&quot; Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, &quot;Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed by Moses who asked me, &apos;What has Allah enjoined on your followers?&apos; I replied, &apos;He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.&apos; Moses said, &apos;Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, &apos;Go back to your Lord as your followers will not be able to bear it.&apos; So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: &apos;Return to your Lord, for your followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, &apos;These are five prayers and they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.&apos; I returned to Moses and he told me to go back once again. I replied, &apos;Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.&apos; Then Gabriel took me till we &apos;&apos; reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundry) which was shrouded in colors, indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls and its earth was of musk.&quot;</text>

He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, &apos;Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined.

The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, &apos;Muhammad (has come).&apos; (Some of our companions added, &quot;With his army.&quot;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;Go and take any slave girl.&apos; He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.&apos; So the Prophet said, &apos;Bring him along with her.&apos; So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, &apos;Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.&apos; Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married her.&quot;
Thabit asked Anas, &quot;O Abu Hamza! What did the Prophet pay her (as Mahr)?&quot; He said, &quot;Her self was her Mahr for he manumitted her and then married her.&quot; Anas added, &quot;While on the way, Um Sulaim dressed her for marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, &apos;Whoever has anything (food) should bring it.&apos; He spread out a leather sheet (for the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter.

When the delegate of &apos;Abd Al-Qais came to Allah&apos;s Apostle, he said, &quot;Who are the delegate?&quot; They said, &quot;The delegate are from the tribe of Rabi&apos;a.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Welcome, O the delegate, and welcome! O people! Neither you will have any disgrace nor will you regret.&quot; They said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Between you and us there are the infidels of the tribe of Mudar, so please order us to do something good (religious deeds) that by acting on them we may enter Paradise, and that we may inform (our people) whom we have left behind, about it.&quot; They also asked (the Prophet) about drinks. He forbade them from four things and ordered them to do four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah, and asked them, &quot;Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know best.&quot; He said, &apos;&apos;To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, the One, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muhammad is Allah&apos;s Apostle; and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay Zakat.&quot; (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramadan is included), &quot;and to give one-fifth of the war booty (to the state).&quot; Then he forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba&apos;, Al-Hantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet said, &quot;Remember all these things by heart and preach it to those whom you have left behind.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas:
When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was &apos;Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, &quot;Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Quran, so Allah&apos;s Book is sufficient for us.&quot; The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, &quot;Come near so that Allah&apos;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&quot; while some of them said what &apos;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &quot;Go away and leave me.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas used to say, &quot;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&apos;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</text>

A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): &apos;Say (O Muhammad): &quot;He is Allah, the One.&quot; (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.&quot;</text>

The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the Sura 112): &apos;Say (O Muhammad): &quot;He is Allah, the One.&quot; &apos; (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them), &quot;Ask him why he does so.&quot; They asked him and he said, &quot;I do so because it mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&quot; The Prophet; said (to them), &quot;Tell him that Allah loves him&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Usama bin Zaid:
We were with the Prophet when suddenly there came to him a messenger from one of his daughters who was asking him to come and see her son who was dying. The Prophet said (to the messenger), &quot;Go back and tell her that whatever Allah takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world). So order her to be patient and hope for Allah&apos;s reward.&quot; But she sent the messenger to the Prophet again, swearing that he should come to her. So the Prophets got up, and so did Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada and Mu&apos;adh bin Jabal (and went to her). When the child was brought to the Prophet his breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were in a water skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon Sa&apos;d said to him, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What is this?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;This is mercy which Allah has put in the heart of His slaves, and Allah bestows His mercy only on those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&quot; (See Hadith No. 373, Vol. 2)</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;Allah will gather the believers on the Day of Resurrection in the same way (as they are gathered in this life), and they will say, &apos;Let us ask someone to intercede for us with our Lord that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Then they will go to Adam and say, &apos;O Adam! Don&apos;t you see the people (people&apos;s condition)? Allah created you with His Own Hands and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all the things. Please intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he had committed, and add, &quot;But you d better go to Noah as he was the first Apostle sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&apos; They will go to Noah who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention the mistake which he made, and add, &apos;But you&apos;d better go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&apos;
They will go to Abraham who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &apos;But you&apos;d better go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and to whom He spoke directly&apos; They will go to Moses who will reply, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking,&apos; and mention to them the mistakes he made, and add, &apos;You&apos;d better go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s slave and His Apostle and His Word (Be: And it was) and a soul created by Him.&apos; They will go to Jesus who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking, but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad whose sins of the past and the future had been forgiven (by Allah).&apos; So they will come to me and I will ask the permission of my Lord, and I will be permitted (to present myself) before Him. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then raise my head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit whom I will admit into Paradise.
I will come back again, and when I see my Lord (again), I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise, I will return again, and when I see my Lord, I will fall down (in prostration) and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will then praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Allah will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise. I will come back and say, &apos;O my Lord! None remains in Hell (Fire) but those whom Qur&apos;an has imprisoned therein and for whom eternity in Hell (Fire) has become inevitable.&apos; &quot;
The Prophet added, &quot;There will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos;La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos; La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: &apos;La ilaha illal-lah,&apos; and has in his heart good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant).&quot;</text>

Be afraid of Allah! &quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Allah). He trusts me over the people of the earth, but you do not trust me?&quot; A man from the people (present then), who, I think, was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill him, but the Prophet prevented him. When the man went away, the Prophet said, &quot;Out of the offspring of this man, there will be people who will recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the game, and they will kill the Muslims and leave the idolators.

      <text>Narrated &apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid Al-Laithi:
On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?&quot; They said, &quot;No, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, &apos;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that thing),&apos; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will (deny Him and) say, &apos;We will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&apos; So Allah will come to them in His appearance which they know, and will say, &apos;I am your Lord.&apos; They will say, &apos;You are our Lord,&apos; so they will follow Him.
Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&apos; I and my followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &apos;O Allah, save! Save!&apos; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&apos;dan? &quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; He said, &quot;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&apos;dan, but none knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the mud of the torrent.
Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &apos;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&apos; So he will invoke Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &apos;If I grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&apos; He will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Allah will demand.
So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, &apos;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&apos; Allah will say to him, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are!&apos; He will say, &apos;O my lord,&apos; and will keep on invoking Allah till He says to him, &apos;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&apos; He will reply, &apos;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&apos;
Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Didn&apos;t you give your covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been given?&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Woe on you, O Adam&apos;s son! How treacherous you are! &apos;
The man will say, &apos;O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of Your creation,&apos; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him, &apos;Enter Paradise,&apos; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &apos;Wish for anything.&apos; So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &apos;(Wish for) so-and-so.&apos; When there is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &apos;This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well.&quot;
&apos;Ata&apos; bin Yazid added: Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri who was present with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that Allah had said, &quot;That is for you and its equal as well,&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri said, &quot;And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!&quot; Abu Huraira said, &quot;I do not remember, except his saying, &apos;That is for you and its equal as well.&apos;&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri then said, &quot;I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, &apos;That is for you, and ten times as much.&apos; &apos; Abu Huraira then added, &quot;That man will be the last person of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise.&quot;
Narrated Abu Sa&apos;id Al-Khudri:
We said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?&quot; We said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&quot; The Prophet then said, &quot;Somebody will then announce, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&apos; So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &quot;What did you use to worship?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&apos; They will reply, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; Then it will be said to them &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &apos;What did you use to worship?&apos;
They will reply, &apos;We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allah.&apos; It will be said, &apos;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?&apos; They will say, &apos;We want You to provide us with water.&apos; It will be said to them, &apos;Drink,&apos; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &apos;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&apos; They will say, &apos;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &apos;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&apos; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&apos; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &apos;I am your Lord,&apos; and they will say, &apos;You are not our Lord.&apos; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &apos;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&apos; They will say. &apos;The Shin,&apos; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&quot; We, the companions of the Prophet said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&apos;
He said, &quot;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&apos;dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe.
They will say, &apos;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.&apos; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&apos; They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &apos;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.&quot; Abu Sa&apos;id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse:--
&apos;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&apos; (4.40) The Prophet added, &quot;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, &apos;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life.
They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, &apos;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).&apos; Then it will be said to them, &apos;For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.&apos;&quot;
Narrated Anas:
The Prophet said, &quot;The believers will be kept (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say, &quot;Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from our place.
Then they will go to Adam and say, &apos;You are Adam, the father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours? Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; He will mention his mistakes he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He will add, &apos;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&apos; The people will go to Noah who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking&apos; He will mention his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&apos; He will say (to them), &apos;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&apos; They will go to Abraham who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). &apos;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought near Him, for conversation.&apos;
They will go to Moses who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to them), &apos;Go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by Allah.&apos; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&apos;s permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&apos; Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me. Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them out and make them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the Prophet said, &quot;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I will be permitted.
When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and then He will say, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&apos; &quot; The Prophet added, &quot;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &apos;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter.
When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him, and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &apos;Raise your head, O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&apos; So I will raise my head and praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&quot; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &quot;So I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for eternal life in the fire).&quot; The narrator then recited the Verse:-- &quot;It may be that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&apos; (17.79) The narrator added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet.</text>

The Prophet said, &quot;Time has come back to its original state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely, Dhul-Qa&apos;da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha&apos;ban.&quot; The Prophet then asked us, &quot;Which month is this?&quot; We said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&quot; He kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it Dhul-Hijja?&quot; We said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked &quot;What town is this?&quot; We said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&apos; Then he kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name.

You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Don&apos;t go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present audience.&quot; Whenever the sub-narrator Muhammad mentioned that statement, he would say, &quot;The Prophet said the truth.&quot;) And then the Prophet added, &quot;No doubt! Haven&apos;t I conveyed Allah&apos;s Message to you! No doubt! Haven&apos;t I conveyed Allah&apos;s Message to you?&quot;</text>

&apos;Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you&apos; Moses asked Allah how to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it was said to him, &apos;When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you will meet him.&apos; So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea.

      <text>Narrated Ma&apos;bad bin Hilal Al&apos;Anzi:
We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about the Hadith of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, &quot;Do not ask him about anything else first but the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; He said, &quot;O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren from Basra coming to ask you about the Hadith of Intercession.&quot; Anas then said, &quot;Muhammad talked to us saying, &apos;On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, &apos;Please intercede for us with your Lord.&apos; He will say, &apos;I am not fit for that but you&apos;d better go to Abraham as he is the Khalil of the Beneficent.&apos; They will go to Abraham and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.&apos; So they will go to Moses and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Jesus as he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.&apos; (Be: And it was) they will go to Jesus and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for that, but you&apos;d better go to Muhammad.&apos;
They would come to me and I would say, &apos;I am for that.&apos; Then I will ask for my Lord&apos;s permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; And then it will be said, &apos;Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before Him. Then it will be said, &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers! My followers!&apos; It will be said, &apos;Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.&apos; I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, &apos;O, Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, my followers!&apos; Then He will say, &apos;Go and take out (all those) in whose hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the Fire.&apos; I will go and do so.&quot;&apos;
When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, &quot;Let&apos;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&quot; So we went to him and we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, &quot;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I have never heard.&quot; He said, &quot;What is that?&quot; Then we told him of the Hadith and said, &quot;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&quot; He said, &quot;What then?&quot; We said, &quot;He did not add anything to that.&quot; He said, Anas related the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&apos;t know whether he forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&quot; We said, &quot;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&quot; He smiled and said, &quot;Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it.
Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet added, &apos;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as he &apos;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted .&apos; I will say, &apos;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, &apos;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&apos; Then Allah will say, &apos;By my Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: &apos;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&apos; &apos;&apos;</text>

      <text>Narrated Anas bin Malik:
The night Allah&apos;s Apostle was taken for a journey from the sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka&apos;ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, &quot;Which of them is he?&quot; The middle (second) angel said, &quot;He is the best of them.&quot; The last (third) angle said, &quot;Take the best of them.&quot; Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not----and so is the case with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on one of its doors.
The dwellers of the Heaven asked, &apos;Who is it?&apos; He said, &quot;Gabriel.&quot; They said, &quot;Who is accompanying you?&quot; He said, &quot;Muhammad.&quot; They said, &quot;Has he been called?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes&quot; They said, &quot;He is welcomed.&quot; So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless Allah informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the Prophet, &quot;He is your father; greet him.&quot; The Prophet greeted him and Adam returned his greeting and said, &quot;Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!&quot; Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, &quot;What are these two rivers, O Gabriel?&quot; Gabriel said, &quot;These are the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates.&quot;
Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, &quot;What is this, O Gabriel?&quot; Gabriel said, &quot;This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for you.&quot; Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., &quot;Who is it?&quot; Gabriel replied, &quot;Gabriel&quot;. They asked, &quot;Who is accompanying you?&quot; He said, &quot;Muhammad.&quot; They asked, &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then they said, &quot;He is welcomed.&apos;&apos; Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the second Heavens had said.
Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don&apos;t remember, on the fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), &quot;O Lord! I thought that none would be raised up above me.&quot;
But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: &quot;Fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.&quot;
Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped him and asked, &quot;O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?&quot; The Prophet replied,&quot; He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a night.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord may reduce it for you and for them.&quot; So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, &quot;Yes, if you wish.&quot; So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in his place, &quot;O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that.&quot; So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to only five prayers.
Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and said, &quot;O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten your burden.&quot;
The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said, &quot;O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so lighten our burden.&quot; On that the Irresistible said, &quot;O Muhammad!&quot; the Prophet replied, &quot;Labbaik and Sa&apos;daik.&quot; Allah said, &quot;The Word that comes from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book.&quot; Allah added, &quot;Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in practice).&quot;
The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, &quot;What have you done?&quot; He said, &quot;He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward.&quot; Moses said, &quot;By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten your burden further.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of returning too many times to my Lord.&quot; On that Gabriel said, &quot;Descend in Allah&apos;s Name.&quot; The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca).</text>

      <text>Narrated Musa bin Abi &apos;Aisha:
Sa&apos;id bin Jubair reported from Ibn &apos;Abbas (regarding the explanation of the Verse: &apos;Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&apos;an) to make haste therewith) . He said, &quot;The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.&apos; Ibn &apos;Abbas said (to Sa&apos;id), &quot;I move them (my lips) as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to move his lips.&quot; And Said said (to me), &quot;I move my lips as I saw Ibn &apos;Abbas moving his lips,&quot; and then he moved his lips. So Allah revealed:--
&apos;(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur&apos;an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).&apos; (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow you its recital.&apos; (75.18) This means, &quot;You should listen to it and keep quiet and then it is upon Us to make you recite it.&quot;
The narrator added, &quot;So Allah&apos;s Apostle used to listen whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur&apos;an as Gabriel had recited it to him.&quot;</text>

      <text>Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas:
regarding the explanation of the Verse:-- &apos;(O Muhammad!) Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&apos; (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Allah&apos;s Apostle was hiding himself at Mecca. At that time, when he led his companions in prayer, he used to raise his voice while reciting the Qur&apos;an; and if the pagans heard him, they would abuse the Qur&apos;an, its Revealer, and the one who brought it. So Allah said to His Prophet: &quot;Neither say your prayer aloud. i.e., your recitation (of Qur&apos;an) lest the pagans should hear (it) and abuse the Quran&quot; nor say it in a low tone, &quot;lest your voice should fail to reach your companions, &quot;but follow a way between.&quot; (17.110)</text>
