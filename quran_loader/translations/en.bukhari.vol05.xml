  <verse index="4" text="Narrated Al-Bara:"/>
  <verse index="4" text="Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &apos;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &apos;Azib, &quot;Tell Al-Bara&apos; to carry the saddle for me.&quot; &apos;Azib said, &quot;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &apos;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &apos;Lie down, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &apos;To whom do you belong, O boy?&apos; He said, &apos;I belong to a man from Quraish.&apos; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &apos;Is there any milk with your sheep?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;Will you then milk (some) for us?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&apos;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &apos;Drink, O Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &apos;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &apos;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&apos; He said, &apos;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="5" text="I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &quot;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&quot; He said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&quot;"/>

  <verse index="6" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &quot;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&quot; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&apos;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&apos;s Apostle added, &quot;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&quot;"/>

May Allah forgive you.&quot; In the meanwhile, &apos;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&apos;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&apos;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&apos;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &apos;You are telling a lie,&apos; while Abu Bakr said, &apos;He has said the truth,&apos; and consoled me with himself and his money.&quot; He then said twice, &quot;Won&apos;t you then give up harming my companion?&quot; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr."/>

Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &quot;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&quot; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &quot;No, by Allah we won&apos;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &apos;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &apos;Umar or Abu &apos;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&quot; &apos;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &quot;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; So &apos;Umar took Abu Bakr&apos;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr.

I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &quot;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&quot; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &quot;Who is it?&quot; He said, &quot;Abu Bakr.&quot; I told him to wait, went in and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle!

As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&apos;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&apos;s Apostle said to him, &quot;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&apos; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &apos;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&apos;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&apos;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &apos;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&apos;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &apos;This is &apos;Uthman&apos;s hand.&apos; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &apos;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &apos;Uthman.&apos; Then Ibn &apos;Umar said to the man, &apos;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&apos;"/>

As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &quot;The dog has killed or eaten me,&quot; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &apos;Umar held the hand of &apos;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer."/>

Find out who attacked me.&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &quot;The slave of Al Mughira.&quot; On that &apos;Umar said, &quot;The craftsman?&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&quot; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &apos;Abbas said to &apos;Umar. &quot;If you wish, we will do.&quot; He meant, &quot;If you wish we will kill them.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;You are mistaken (for you can&apos;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&quot;"/>

Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &quot;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&apos;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know.

His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things."/>
  <verse index="50" text="I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them.

I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &apos;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &apos;Arabs and the material of Islam.

So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &apos;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&quot; Then he took the other (i.e. &apos;Uthman) aside and said the same to him.

The laborer asked (him), &quot;Will you go for the pilgrimage?&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I will attend it.&quot; The (Hashimi) laborer said, &quot;Will you please convey a message for me once in your life?&quot; The other man said, &quot;yes.&quot; The laborer wrote: &apos;When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you, call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter.&quot; Then the laborer expired. When the employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, &quot;What has happened to our companion?&quot; He said, &quot;He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died) and I buried him.&quot; Then Abu Talib said, &quot;The deceased deserved this from you.&quot; After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, &quot;O the family of Quraish!&quot; The people replied, &quot;This is Quraish.&quot; Then he called, &quot;O the family of Banu Hashim!&quot; Again the people replied, &quot;This is Banu Hashim.&quot; He asked, &quot;Who is Abu Talib?&quot; The people replied, &quot;This is Abu Talib.&quot; He said, &quot;&apos;So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel).&quot; Then Abu Talib went to the (Quraishi) killer and said to him, &quot;Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas.&quot; The killer went to his people and they said, &quot;We will take an oath.&quot; Then a woman from Banu Hashim who was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him, came to Abu Talib and said, &quot;O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the oath-taking is carried on.&quot; Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came (to Abu Talib) and said, &quot;O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him. Then 48 men came and took the oath.

The man said, &quot;I have never seen such a day on which a Muslim is faced with such an accusation.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;I am determined that you should tell me the truth.&quot; He said, &quot;I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance.&quot; Then &apos;Umar said, &quot;Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of.&quot; He said, &quot;One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, &apos;Haven&apos;t you seen the Jinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening to the news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e. &apos;Arabs)?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;He is right.&quot; and added, &quot;One day while I was near their idols, there came a man with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, &apos;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).&apos; On that the people fled, but I said, &apos;I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.&apos; Then the cry came again: &apos;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&apos; I then went away and a few days later it was said, &quot;A prophet has appeared.&quot;"/>

So he has chosen that good which is with Allah.&quot; On that Abu Bakr wept and said, &quot;Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you.&quot; We became astonished at this. The people said, &quot;Look at this old man! Allah&apos;s Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says. &apos;our fathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you.&quot; But it was Allah&apos;s Apostle who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than we. Allah&apos;s Apostle added, &quot;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is. sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="245" text="Narrated &apos;Aisha:"/>
  <verse index="245" text="(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don&apos;t remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah&apos;s Apostle in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina said, &quot;O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="245" text="So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. &quot;A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?&quot; So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina&apos;s protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, &quot;Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house."/>
  <verse index="245" text="Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, &quot;We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (&quot;O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the &apos;Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="245" text="At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, &quot;In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.&quot; So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah&apos;s Apostle said to him, &quot;Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah&apos;s Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months."/>
  <verse index="245" text="One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr&apos;s house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, &quot;This is Allah&apos;s Apostle with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. &quot;Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;i have been given permission to migrate.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle replied, &quot;(I will accept it) with payment.&quot; So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr&apos;s daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts)."/>
  <verse index="245" text="Then Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. &apos;Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-&apos;As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), &apos;Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore."/>
  <verse index="245" text="The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju&apos;sham said that his father informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju&apos;sham saying, &quot;The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and said, &quot;O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.&quot; Suraqa added, &quot;I too realized that it must have been they. But I said &apos;No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.&apos; I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me."/>
  <verse index="245" text="Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by Allah&apos;s Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Allah&apos;s Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, &quot;Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head.&quot; Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, &quot;Do not tell others about us.&quot; Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered &apos;Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah&apos;s Apostle proceeded on his way."/>
  <verse index="245" text="Narrated &apos;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah&apos;s Apostle met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah&apos;s Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage."/>
  <verse index="245" text="The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, &quot;O you &apos;Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!&quot; So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah&apos;s Apostle on the summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani &apos;Amr bin &apos;Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah&apos;s Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah&apos;s Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah&apos;s Apostle. Allah&apos;s Apostle stayed with Bani &apos;Amr bin &apos;Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah&apos;s Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah&apos;s Apostle at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of &apos;Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, &quot;No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying &quot;This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.&quot; He was also saying, &quot;O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.&quot; Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me."/>

  <verse index="250" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while Allah&apos;s Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day, &quot;O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?&quot; Abu Bakr would say, &quot;This man shows me the Way,&quot; One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider persuing them. He said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! This is a horse-rider persuing us.&quot; The Prophet looked behind and said, &quot;O Allah! Cause him to fall down.&quot; So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Prophet! Order me whatever you want.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.&quot; So, in the first part of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah&apos;s Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Allah&apos;s Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Allah&apos;s Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they said, &quot;Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah&apos;s Prophet had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying &quot;Allah&apos;s Prophet has come! Allah&apos;s Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family members of Abu Aiyub, &apos;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to Allah&apos;s Prophet and then went home."/>
  <verse index="250" text="Then Allah&apos;s Prophet said, &quot;Which is the nearest of the houses of our Kith and kin?&quot; Abu Aiyub replied, &quot;Mine, O Allah&apos;s Prophet!

The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam, for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered.

By Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam.&quot; The Jews replied, &quot;We do not know this.&quot; So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then he said, &quot;What sort of a man is &apos;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&quot; They said, &quot;He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of the most learned amongst us.&quot; He said, &quot;What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot; What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot;What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&quot; They said, &quot;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&quot; He said, &quot;O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them.&quot; He came out and said, &quot;O (the group of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped.

Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&quot; He said, &quot;No, but I do not want to go with them but for a short distance.&quot; So when Umaiya went out, he used to tie his camel wherever he camped.

So they sent about one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, &quot;These dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&quot; and went on tracing the Muslims&apos; footsteps. When &apos;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them and said, &quot;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&quot; &apos;Asim bin Thabit said, &quot;O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&quot; So the archers threw their arrows at them and martyred &apos;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. The third man said, &quot;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with you for I follow the example of these.&quot; He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him).

By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, &quot;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&quot; Later on (while narrating the story) she said, &quot;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib.

If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&quot; Then Abu Sarva, &apos;Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &apos;Asim bin Thabit&apos;s death, sent some messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr).

Go out to them (to attack them).&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Where?&quot; Gabriel pointed towards Bani Quraiza. So Allah&apos;s Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They then surrendered to the Prophet&apos;s judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict concerning them. Sad said, &quot;I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed, their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties distributed.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="448" text="Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that &apos;Aisha said, &quot;Sad said, &quot;O Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e. Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.&apos; So blood gushed from the wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the blood flowing towards them . They said, &apos;O people of the tent! What is this thing which is coming to us from your side?&apos; Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad&apos;s wound. Sad then died because of that.&quot;"/>

I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone."/>
  <verse index="462" text="Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the call.

While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited Istirja&apos; (i.e. &quot;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&apos;un&quot;) as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&apos;. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk (i.e. slander) more, was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&quot;"/>

It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&quot; Urwa added, &quot;&apos;Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she used to say, &apos;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father&apos;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&apos;s honor from you.&quot;)."/>
  <verse index="462" text="&apos;Aisha added, &quot;After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah&apos;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Allah&apos;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&apos; How is that (lady)?&apos; and leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&apos; where we used to answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &apos;Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin &apos;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin &apos;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &apos;Let Mistah be ruined!&apos; I said, &apos;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&apos; On that she said, &apos;O you Hantah! Didn&apos;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &apos;I said, &apos;What did he say?&apos;"/>
  <verse index="462" text="Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting me, said, &apos;How is that (lady)?&apos; I said, &apos;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&apos; as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&apos;s Apostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, &apos;O mother! What are the people talking about?&apos; She said, &apos;O my daughter! Don&apos;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would find faults with her.&apos; I said, &apos;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really talking in this way?&apos; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping.

  <verse index="462" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle called &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me.

She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&apos; &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&apos; On that Allah&apos;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &apos;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&apos; Barira said to him, &apos;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth.

  <verse index="462" text="So, on that day, Allah&apos;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and complained about &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &apos;O you Muslims!

By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&apos; Sad bin Mu&apos;adh the brother of Banu &apos;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle!

Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&apos;adh). &apos;By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="462" text="On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu&apos;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &apos;Ubada, &apos;By Allah! You are a liar!

Allah&apos;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing, and I could never sleep."/>
  <verse index="462" text="In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah&apos;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &apos;Amma Badu, O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="462" text="When Allah&apos;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, &apos;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&apos; My father said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle .&apos; Then I said to my mother, &apos;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &apos;By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&apos;s father when he said, &apos;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&apos; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&apos;s Apostle might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&apos;s Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle."/>

Allah has declared your innocence!&apos; Then my Mother said to me, &apos;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&apos;s Apostle). I replied, &apos;By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:-- &quot;Verily!

In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &quot;What are these fires? For cooking what, are you making the fire?&quot; The people replied, &quot;(For cooking) meat.&quot; He asked, &quot;What kind of meat?&quot; They (i.e. people) said, &quot;The meat of donkeys.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&quot; Some man said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead?&quot; He said, &quot;(Yes, you can do) that too.&quot; So when the army files were arranged in rows (for the clash), &apos;Amir&apos;s sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah&apos;s Apostle saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &quot;What is bothering you?&quot; I replied, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the deeds of &apos;Amir are lost.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever says so, is mistaken, for &apos;Amir has got a double reward.&quot; The Prophet raised two fingers and added, &quot;He (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few &apos;Arabs who achieved the like of (good deeds) &apos;Amir had done.&quot;"/>

The Prophet said it thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Allah has made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours.&quot; The Prophet added: No doubt! Haven&apos;t I conveyed Allah&apos;s Message to you? &quot; They replied, &quot;Yes,&quot; The Prophet said thrice, &quot;O Allah! Be witness for it.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;Woe to you!&quot; (or said), &quot;May Allah be merciful to you!

Then the Prophet said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Which town is this?&quot; &quot;We replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; On that he kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it the town of Mecca?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes, &quot; Then he said, &quot;Which day is today?&quot; We replied, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know better.&quot; He kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &quot;Isn&apos;t it the day of An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?&quot; We replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;So your blood, your properties, (The sub-narrator Muhammad said, &apos;I think the Prophet also said: And your honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will understand it better than those who have actually heard it.&quot; (The sub-narrator, Muhammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, &quot;Muhammad spoke the truth!&quot;) He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, &quot;No doubt!

Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to Medina)?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;If you remain behind, any good deed which you will do for Allah&apos;s Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you.&quot; The Prophet then added, &quot;O Allah!

So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become &apos;angry with me. So I returned to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had passed when I heard Bilal calling, &quot;O &apos;Abdullah bin Qais!&quot; I replied to his call. Bilal said, &quot;Respond to Allah&apos;s Apostle who is calling you.&quot; When I went to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, &quot;Take these two camels tied together and also these two camels tied together,&quot;&apos; referring to six camels he had brought them from Sad at that time.

Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Allah&apos;s Apostle has not said.&quot; They said to me, &quot;We consider you truthful, and we will do what you like.&quot; The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Allah&apos;s Apostle wherein he denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same.

So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter&apos;s claim as invalid (i.e. the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor).

  <verse index="702" text="Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik:"/>
  <verse index="702" text="Who, from among Kab&apos;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which he failed to take part. Kab said, &quot;I did not remain behind Allah&apos;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&apos;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&apos;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&apos;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&apos;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa."/>
  <verse index="702" text="By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&apos;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&apos;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&quot; Ka&apos;b added, &quot;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&apos;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&apos;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &apos;I can do that.&apos; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&apos;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&apos; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything."/>
  <verse index="702" text="Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&apos;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused. Allah&apos;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &apos;What did Ka&apos;b do?&apos; A man from Banu Salama said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&apos; Then Mu&apos;adh bin Jabal said, &apos;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&apos; Allah&apos;s Apostle kept silent.&quot; Ka&apos;b bin Malik added, &quot;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &apos;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&apos; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&apos;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah&apos;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&apos;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&apos;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &apos;Come on.&apos; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &apos;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&apos; I answered, &quot;Yes, O Allah&apos;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse."/>
  <verse index="702" text="By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&apos;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&apos; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&apos; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &apos;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&apos;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&apos;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&apos; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &apos;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&apos; They replied, &apos;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&apos; I said, &apos;Who are they?&apos; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&apos; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&apos;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it."/>
  <verse index="702" text="We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&apos;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &apos;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&apos; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &quot;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&apos; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&quot; Ka&apos;b added, &quot;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &apos;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&apos; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:"/>
  <verse index="702" text="&quot;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="702" text="When I read it, I said to myself, &apos;This is also a sort of a test.&apos; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&apos;s Apostle and said, &apos;Allah&apos;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&apos; I said, &apos;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&apos; He said, &apos;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&apos; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &apos;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&quot; Kab added, &quot;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &apos; He said, &apos;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="702" text="On that, some of my family members said to me, &apos;Will you also ask Allah&apos;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&apos; I said, &apos;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&apos;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&apos;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&apos; Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&apos;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&apos; calling with his loudest voice, &apos;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&apos; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&apos;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&apos;s Apostle."/>
  <verse index="702" text="The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&apos;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &apos;We congratulate you on Allah&apos;s Acceptance of your repentance.&quot; Kab further said, &quot;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&apos;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&quot; Kab added, &quot;When I greeted Allah&apos;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &quot;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&quot; Kab added, &quot;I said to the Prophet &apos;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&apos; He said, &apos;No, it is from Allah.&apos; Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&apos; I said, &apos;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&apos; and added, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&apos;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:--"/>
  <verse index="702" text="&quot;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&quot; (9.117-119)"/>
  <verse index="702" text="By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&apos;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- &quot;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people--&quot; (9.95-96) Kab added, &quot;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&apos;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&apos;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&quot; (9.118)"/>
  <verse index="702" text="What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses."/>
