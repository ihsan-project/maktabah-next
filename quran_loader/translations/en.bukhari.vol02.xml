I did not perform more than the ablution.&quot; Thereupon &apos;Umar said to him, &quot;Did you perform only the ablution although you know that Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) used to order us to take a bath (on Fridays)?&quot;"/>

The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband&apos;s house and is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master&apos;s belongings and is responsible for them.&apos; I thought that he also said, &apos;A man is the guardian of his father&apos;s property and is responsible for it.

But the people disliked it. Ibn Abbas said, &quot;It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="25" text="(the wife of the Prophet) The people used to come from their abodes and from Al-&apos;Awali (i.e. outskirts of Medina up to a distance of four miles or more from Medina).

Allah&apos;s Apostle sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, &apos;Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.&apos; So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Allah&apos;s Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Allah&apos;s Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, &apos;I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray.&apos; &quot;"/>

By Allah, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-contented with the goodness and wealth which Allah has put into their hearts and &apos;Amr bin Taghlib is one of them.&quot; Amr added, By Allah! Those words of Allah&apos;s Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels."/>

  <verse index="46" text="Once in the middle of the night Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Allah&apos;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Allah&apos;s Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited &quot;Tashah-hud&quot; (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle), and then said, &quot;Amma ba&apos;du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud) might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out.&quot;"/>

Come to me.&quot; So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, &quot;Amma ba&apos;du.&quot; &quot;From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muhammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers.&quot;"/>

While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, &quot;O, Allah&apos;s Apostle! Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Allah (for rain)&quot;. So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Allah (to protect us)&quot;. So the Prophet I raised both his hands and said, &quot;O Allah! Round about us and not on us&quot;. So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina&apos;s (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about the abundant rain."/>

And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&apos;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&apos;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&apos;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &apos;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&apos;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them."/>

Didn&apos;t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes, I did.&quot; He said, &quot;Then there is no harm, depart.&quot; So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa."/>

  <verse index="820" text="Ibn &apos;Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or &apos;Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka&apos;ba seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking in the last four. On finishing, he would offer two Rakat prayer and set out to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to his dwelling place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or &apos;Umra, he used to make his camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at Dhu-l-Hulaifa, the place where the Prophet used to make his camel kneel down."/>

I said, &quot;I don&apos;t doubt about &apos;Isha&apos; (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while.
