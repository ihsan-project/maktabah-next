  <verse index="1" text="While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah&apos;s Apostle called me but I did not respond to him. Later I said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I was praying.&quot; He said, &quot;Didn&apos;t Allah say&apos;--&quot;Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you.&quot; (8.24)"/>
  <verse index="1" text="He then said to me, &quot;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Qur&apos;an, before you leave the Mosque.&quot; Then he got hold of my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, &quot;Didn&apos;t you say to me, &apos;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Quran?&apos; He said, &quot;Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab&apos;a Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur&apos;an which has been given to me.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="2" text="Narrated Abu Huraira:"/>
  <verse index="2" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;When the Imam says: &apos;Ghair-il-Maghdubi &apos;Alaihim Walad-Dallin (i.e. not the path of those who earn Your Anger, nor the path of those who went astray (1.7)), then you must say, &apos;Ameen&apos;, for if one&apos;s utterance of &apos;Ameen&apos; coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="3" text="Narrated Anas:"/>
  <verse index="3" text="The Prophet said, &quot;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &apos;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&apos; So they will go to Adam and say, &apos;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&apos; Adam will say, &apos;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&apos; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &apos;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&apos; They will go to him and Noah will say,"/>
  <verse index="3" text="&apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &apos;Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&apos; They will go to him and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&apos; So they will go to him and he will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking.&apos; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &apos;Go to Jesus, Allah&apos;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&apos;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &apos;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&apos; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&apos;s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.&apos; (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&apos; I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, &apos;None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.&apos; &quot; (The compiler) Abu &apos;Abdullah said: &apos;But those whom the Qur&apos;an has imprisoned in Hell,&apos; refers to the Statement of Allah:"/>

  <verse index="5" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;The Kam&apos;a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="6" text="The Prophet said, &quot;It was said to the children of Israel, &apos;Enter the gate (of the town), prostrate (in humility) and say: Hittatun (i.e. repentance) i.e. O Allah!"/>

  <verse index="7" text="Narrated Anas:"/>
  <verse index="7" text="&apos;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&apos;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &quot;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&apos;. The Prophet said, &quot;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&quot; &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;Gabriel?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&quot; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:--"/>
  <verse index="7" text="&quot;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&apos;an) down to your heart by Allah&apos;s permission.&quot; (2.97) Then he added, &quot;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&apos;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&apos;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&quot; On hearing that, &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&apos;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&quot; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &quot;What is &apos;Abdullah&apos;s status amongst you?&quot; They replied, &quot;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;What would you think if &apos;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&quot; They replied, &quot;May Allah protect him from this!&quot; Then &apos;Abdullah came out and said, &quot;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&quot; The Jews then said, &quot;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&quot; and disparaged him. On that &apos;Abdullah said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!&quot;"/>
  <verse index="8" text="Narrated Ibn Abbas:"/>
  <verse index="8" text="Umar said, &quot;Our best Qur&apos;an reciter is Ubai and our best judge is &apos;Ali; and in spite of this, we leave some of the statements of Ubai because Ubai says, &apos;I do not leave anything that I have heard from Allah&apos;s Apostle while Allah:"/>

  <verse index="9" text="Narrated Ibn Abbas:"/>
  <verse index="9" text="The Prophet said, &quot;Allah said, &apos;The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is that he claims that I cannot recreate him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me, it is his statement that I have offspring. No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.&apos; &quot;"/>
  <verse index="10" text="Narrated Anas:"/>
  <verse index="10" text="Umar said, &quot;I agreed with Allah in three things,&quot; or said, &quot;My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.&apos; I also said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.&apos; So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, &apos;You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.&apos; When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, &apos;O &apos;Umar! Does Allah&apos;s Apostle haven&apos;t what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?&apos; &quot; Thereupon Allah revealed:--"/>

  <verse index="11" text="(The wife of the Prophet) Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Don&apos;t you see that when your people built the Ka&apos;ba, they did not build it on all Abraham&apos;s foundations?&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Why don&apos;t you rebuild it on Abraham&apos;s foundations?&quot; He said, &quot;Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so.&quot; The sub-narrator, &apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar said, &quot;Aisha had surely heard Allah&apos;s Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Allah&apos;s Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka&apos;ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka&apos;ba was not built on all Abraham&apos;s foundations.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="12" text="Narrated Abu Huraira:"/>
  <verse index="12" text="The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims.

  <verse index="13" text="Narrated Al-Bara:"/>
  <verse index="13" text="The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka&apos;ba (at Mecca). (So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &apos;Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka&apos;ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &quot;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.&quot; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&apos;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&apos;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:-- &quot;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.&quot; (2.143)"/>

  <verse index="14" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Noah will be called on the Day of Resurrection and he will say, &apos;Labbaik and Sa&apos;daik, O my Lord!&apos; Allah will say, &apos;Did you convey the Message?&apos; Noah will say, &apos;Yes.&apos; His nation will then be asked, &apos;Did he convey the Message to you?&apos; They will say, &apos;No Warner came to us.&apos; Then Allah will say (to Noah), &apos;Who will bear witness in your favor?&apos; He will say, &apos;Muhammad and his followers. So they (i.e. Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message. And the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah &quot;Thus We have made of you a just and the best nation that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Apostle (Muhammad) will be a witness over yourselves.&quot;"/>

A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions.&quot; The man said, &quot;What is your opinion about &apos;Uthman and &apos;Ali?&quot; Ibn &apos;Umar said, &quot;As for &apos;Uthman, it seems that Allah has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven. And as for &apos;Ali, he is the cousin of Allah&apos;s Apostle and his son-in-law.&quot; Then he pointed with his hand and said, &quot;That is his house which you see.&quot;"/>

Heraclius said, &apos;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&apos; The people replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &apos;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&apos; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &apos;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&apos;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&apos; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &apos;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s) family status amongst you? I said, &apos;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&quot; Heraclius said, &apos;Was any of his ancestors a king?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&apos; I said, &apos;It is the poor who followed him.&apos; He said, &apos;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&apos; I said, &apos;The are increasing.&apos; He said, &apos;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Did you fight with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;How was your fighting with him?&apos; I said, &apos;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&apos; He said, &apos;Did he ever betray?&apos; I said, &apos;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &apos;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &apos;No.&apos; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &apos;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&quot; Abu Safyan said, &quot;Heraclius then asked me, &apos;What does he order you to do?&apos; I said, &apos;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&apos; Then Heraclius said, &apos;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&apos; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:"/>

The Prophet kept quiet and did not give them any answer. I knew that he was being divinely inspired so I stayed at my place. When the divine inspiration had been revealed, the Prophet said. &quot;They ask you (O, Muhammad) concerning the Spirit, Say: &quot;The spirit,&quot; its knowledge is with my Lord; and of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a Little.&quot; (17.85)"/>

When he prayed with his companions, he used to raise his voice with the recitation of Qur&apos;an, and if the pagans happened to hear him, they would abuse the Qur&apos;an, the One who revealed it and the one who brought it. Therefore Allah said to His Prophet : &apos;Neither say your prayer aloud.&apos; (17.110) i.e. do not recite aloud lest the pagans should hear you, but follow a way between."/>

So Allah revealed to him: &apos;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.&apos; Moses asked, &apos;O my Lord, how can I meet him?&apos; Allah said, &apos;Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.&apos; So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha&apos; bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel).

Then a man came to Moses and asked, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&apos; Moses replied, &apos;No.&apos; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah.

His attend an said (to himself), &quot;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &apos;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &quot;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&quot; Moses said &quot;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&quot; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &apos;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &apos;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &quot;What do you want?&apos; Moses said, &apos; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&apos; Al-Khadir said, &apos;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&apos; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &apos;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&apos;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&apos; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side.

Ya&apos;la said, &apos;I think Said said, &apos;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &apos;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it.

Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &apos;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&apos; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &apos;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&apos; (18:81).

  <verse index="274" text="(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&apos;s Apostle after Allah&apos;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&apos;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&apos;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &quot;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&quot; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &quot;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&quot; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&apos;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&apos;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &quot;How is that (lady)?&quot; and then depart."/>
  <verse index="274" text="That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &apos;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &quot;Let Mistah be ruined ! &quot; I said to her, &quot;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&apos; She said, &quot;O you there! Didn&apos;t you hear what he has said?&quot; I said, &quot;And what did he say?&quot; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &quot;How is that (lady)?&quot; I said, &quot;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&quot; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&apos;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &quot;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&quot; My mother said, &quot;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&quot; I said, &quot;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&quot;"/>
  <verse index="274" text="That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&apos;s Apostle called &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&apos;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&quot; But &apos;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&quot; &apos;Aisha added: So Allah&apos;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &quot;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &quot;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&quot; So Allah&apos;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&apos;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &quot;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&quot; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&quot; On that, Sad bin &apos;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &quot;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&quot; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &apos;Ubada, &quot;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&quot; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&apos;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&apos;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&apos;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &quot;Thereafter, O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&apos;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&quot; When Allah&apos;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &quot;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&quot; He said, &quot;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Then I said to my mother, &quot;Reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="274" text="She said, &quot;I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &quot;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&apos;s father: &quot;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&apos;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&apos;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &quot;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&quot; My mother said to me, &quot;Get up and go to him.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&quot; So Allah revealed: &quot;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not....&quot; (24.11-20)."/>

So Allah revealed:"/>
  <verse index="274" text="&quot;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&apos;s Cause.

He said, &quot;O Zainab! What have you seen?&quot; She replied, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&quot; Of all the wives of Allah&apos;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety.

By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her.

My mother asked, &quot;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&quot; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &quot;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&quot; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &quot;Does my father know about it?&quot; She said, &quot;yes&quot; I asked, Does Allah&apos;s Apostle know about it too?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes, Allah&apos;s Apostle does too.&quot; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &quot;What is the matter with her? &quot; She said, &quot;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&quot; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &quot;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&quot; I went back to my home and Allah&apos;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &quot;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&quot; On that, some of the Prophet&apos;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &quot;Tell the truth to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &quot;Subhan Allah!

By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&quot; Later that man was martyred in Allah&apos;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&apos;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer.

If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&quot; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &quot;Isn&apos;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&apos;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &quot;What should I say?&quot; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &quot;What should I say?&quot; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &quot;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&quot; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &quot;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &apos;She has confessed herself guilty.&quot; By Allah, &apos;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&apos;s name but couldn&apos;t) Joseph&apos;s father when he said; So (for me) &quot;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&apos; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &quot;Have the good tidings O &apos; &quot;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&quot; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &quot;Get up and go to him.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&quot; (Aisha used to say:) &quot;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&apos;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:--"/>
  <verse index="281" text="&quot;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot; (24.22)"/>
