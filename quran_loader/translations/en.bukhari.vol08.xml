  <verse index="817" text="&apos;Abdur-Rahman said, &quot;I said, &apos;O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophet&apos;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&apos; On that, &apos;Umar said, &apos;By Allah!

  <verse index="817" text="In the meantime, &apos;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &apos;Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &quot;Now then, I am going to tell you something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it.

And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&apos;s Book: &apos;O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.&apos; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Allah&apos;s Slave and His Apostles.&apos; (O people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, &apos;By Allah, if &apos;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.&apos; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed."/>
  <verse index="817" text="And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. &apos;Ali and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, &apos;Let&apos;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, &apos;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you going?&apos; We replied, &apos;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&apos; They said to us, &apos;You shouldn&apos;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&apos; I said, &apos;By Allah, we will go to them.&apos; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&apos;da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &apos;Who is that man?&apos; They said, &apos;He is Sa&apos;d bin &apos;Ubada.&apos; I asked, &apos;What is wrong with him?&apos; They said, &apos;He is sick.&apos; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&apos;s speaker said, &apos;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&apos; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &apos;To proceed, we are Allah&apos;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="817" text="When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &apos;Wait a while.&apos; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, &apos;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&apos;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&apos;t feel at present.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="817" text="And then one of the Ansar said, &apos;I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you.&apos;"/>
  <verse index="817" text="Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &apos;O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.&apos; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa&apos;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the Ansar said, &apos;You have killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; I replied, &apos;Allah has killed Sa&apos;d bin Ubada.&apos; Umar added, &quot;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&quot;"/>

Allah&apos;s Apostle said to them, &quot;What do you find in the Torah regarding the Rajam?&quot; They replied, &quot;We only disgrace and flog them with stripes.&quot; &apos;Abdullah bin Salam said to them, &apos;You have told a lie the penalty of Rajam is in the Torah.&apos; They brought the Torah and opened it. One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &quot;Lift up your hand.&quot; Where he lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &quot;O Muhammad! He has said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&quot; Then Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death, and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her from the stones."/>
