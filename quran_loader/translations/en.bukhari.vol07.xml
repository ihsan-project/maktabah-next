  <verse index="1" text="A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that, they considered their worship insufficient and said, &quot;Where are we from the Prophet as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&quot; Then one of them said, &quot;I will offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&quot; The other said, &quot;I will fast throughout the year and will not break my fast.&quot; The third said, &quot;I will keep away from the women and will not marry forever.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle came to them and said, &quot;Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one of my followers).&quot;"/>

That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&apos; (4.3) &apos;Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&quot;"/>

They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them and marry other women.

When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the threshold of &apos;Aisha&apos;s dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with him.

Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures.

He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her house was spacious.

As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of her husband&apos;s other wife.

(66.4) till &apos;Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &apos;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when &apos;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &quot;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &apos;If you two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?&quot; (66.4) He said, &quot;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &apos;Aisha and Hafsa.&quot; Then &apos;Umar went on narrating the Hadith and said, &quot;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &apos;Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the night.&apos; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &apos;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&apos; Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &apos;Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?&apos; She said, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;You are a ruined losing person! Don&apos;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&apos;s Apostle and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., &apos;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet .&quot; Umar added,&quot;At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said, &apos;Today a great thing has happened.&apos; I asked, &apos;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?&apos; He said, &apos;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Allah&apos;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &apos;Umar added, &quot;The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said &quot;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&apos; I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &apos;What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&apos; She said, &apos;I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&apos; I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, &apos;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for &apos;Umar (to enter)?&apos; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying, &apos;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&apos; Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave, &apos;Will you get the permission for &apos;Umar?&apos; He went in and returned saying, &apos;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&apos; So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &apos;Will you get the permission for &apos;Umar?&apos; He went in and returned to me saying, &apos;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&apos; When I was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &apos;The Prophet has given you permission.&apos; Then I entered upon Allah&apos;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&apos; He looked at me and said, &apos;No.&apos; I said, &apos;Allah Akbar!&apos; And then, while still standing, I said chatting, &apos;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&apos;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were overpowered by their women.&apos; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &apos;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&apos;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &quot;Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&apos;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&apos; &quot; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Allah.&apos; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &apos;Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.&apos; I said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Ask Allah to forgive me.&apos; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to &apos;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &apos;I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,&apos; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon &apos;Aisha. &apos;Aisha said to him, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one.&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&apos; &apos;Aisha added, &apos;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him.&apos; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what &apos;Aisha had said . &quot; (1) The Prophet, &apos; had decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so.

  <verse index="229" text="Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl bin Sad, the brother of Bani Sa&apos;idi He said, &quot;An Ansari man came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?&apos; So Allah revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Quran about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, &apos;Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.&apos; So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet .&quot; Ibn Shihab added, &quot;After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother&apos;s name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him.&quot; Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As&apos;Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above narration), &quot;If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth.&quot; Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty)."/>

The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, &apos;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&apos; So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he had found her with. The Prophet then made them carry out Lian.&quot; Then a man from that gathering asked Ibn &apos;Abbas, &quot;Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, &apos;If I were to stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady&apos;?&quot; Ibn &apos;Abbas said, &quot;No, that was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. &quot;"/>

You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&apos;Ali) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &apos;If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will manage it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&apos; So you both said, &apos;Hand over this property to us on this condition.&apos; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?&quot; The group said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Umar then faced &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas and said, &quot;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&quot; They both said, &quot;Yes.&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &quot;"/>
