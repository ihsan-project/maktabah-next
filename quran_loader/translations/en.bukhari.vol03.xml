  <verse index="1" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;(The performance of) &apos;Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="4" text="Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw &apos;Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed &apos;Umra. He replied, &apos;Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.&quot; We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard &apos;Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. &apos;Ursa said, &quot;O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don&apos;t you hear what Abu &apos;Abdur Rahman is saying?&quot; She said, &quot;What does he say?&quot; &apos;Ursa said, &quot;He says that Allah&apos;s Apostle performed four &apos;Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.&quot; &apos;Aisha said, &quot;May Allah be merciful to Abu &apos;Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any &apos;Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any &apos;Umra in Rajab.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="7" text="Narrated Qatada:"/>
  <verse index="7" text="I asked Anas (about the Prophet&apos;s &apos;Umra) and he replied, &quot;The Prophet performed &apos;Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another &apos;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&apos;da, and another &apos;Umra in combination with his Hajj.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="8" text="The Prophet performed four &apos;Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa&apos;da except the (one) &apos;Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His &apos;Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr&apos;rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another &apos;Umra with his Hajj."/>
  <verse index="9" text="Narrated Abu Ishaq:"/>
  <verse index="9" text="I asked Masruq, &apos;Ata&apos; and Mujahid (about the &apos;Umra of Allah&apos;s Apostle).

  <verse index="11" text="Narrated Aisha:"/>
  <verse index="11" text="We set out along with Allah&apos;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, &quot;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for &apos;Umra may do so. Hadn&apos;t I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra.&quot; (&apos;Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra. The day of &apos;Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, &quot;Abandon your &apos;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.&quot; When it was the night of Hasba, he sent &apos;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan&apos;im and I assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed &apos;Umra."/>
  <verse index="12" text="Narrated &apos;Amr bin Aus:"/>
  <verse index="12" text="Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let &apos;Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform &apos;Umra from At-Tan&apos;im."/>
  <verse index="13" text="Narrated Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah:"/>
  <verse index="13" text="The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. &apos;Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (&apos;Ali) said, &quot;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah&apos;s Apostle has assumed it.&quot; The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for &apos;Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, &quot;Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?&quot; The Prophet heard that and said, &quot;Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.&quot; &apos;Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba, she said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and &apos;Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!&quot; So, he ordered &apos;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan&apos;im. Thus she performed &apos;Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju&apos;sham met the Prophet at Al-&apos;Aqaba (Jamrat-ul &apos;Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform &apos;Umra before Hajj.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="14" text="Narrated &apos;Aisha:"/>
  <verse index="14" text="We set out with Allah&apos;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, &quot;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for &apos;Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra.&quot; Some of the people assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of &apos;Arafat. I complained to Allah&apos;s Apostle about it, he said, &quot;Abandon your &apos;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.&quot; So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent &apos;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim."/>
  <verse index="14" text="The sub-narrator adds: He (&apos;AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for &apos;Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and &apos;Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her."/>
  <verse index="15" text="Narrated Al-Aswad:"/>
  <verse index="15" text="That &apos;Aisha said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and &apos;Umra) but I am returning with one only?&quot; He said, &quot;Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan&apos;im, assume Ihram (and after performing &apos;Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if &apos;Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it).&quot;"/>
  <verse index="16" text="Narrated &apos;Aisha:"/>
  <verse index="16" text="We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, &quot;Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as &apos;Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.&quot; The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the &apos;Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, &quot;I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the &apos;Umra.&quot; He asked me, &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; I replied, &quot;I am not praying.&quot; He said, &quot;There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the &apos;Umra as well.&quot; So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called &apos;Abdur-Rahman and said, &quot;Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for &apos;Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.&quot; We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, &quot;Have you finished?&quot; I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina."/>
  <verse index="17" text="Narrated Safwan bin Ya&apos;la bin Umaiya from his father who said:"/>
  <verse index="17" text="&quot;A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji&apos;rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), &apos;What do you order me to perform in my &apos;Umra?&apos; So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. &apos;Umar said to me, &apos;Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?&apos; I replied in the affirmative. &apos;Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, &quot;Where is the questioner who asked about &apos;Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka&apos;ba and the Sa&apos;i between Safa and Marwa). &quot;"/>

  <verse index="18" text="&quot;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or &apos;Umra of the House (Ka&apos;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them.&quot; &apos;Aisha replied, &quot;No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: &apos;It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.&apos; This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah&apos;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:--"/>

  <verse index="19" text="Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: &quot;Allah&apos;s Apostle performed &apos;Umra and we too performed &apos;Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka&apos;ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow.&quot; A friend of his asked him (i.e. &apos;Abdullah bin Aufa), &quot;Did the Prophet enter the Ka&apos;ba (during that &apos;Umra)?&quot; He replied in the negative. Then he said, &quot;What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?&quot; He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said, &quot;(He said) &apos;Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="20" text="We asked Ibn &apos;Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, &quot;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&apos;ba seven times and then offered a two Rak&apos;at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah&apos;s Apostle you have a good example.&quot; And we asked Jabir bin &apos;Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, &quot;He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa.&quot;"/>

Perform the Tawaf of the Ka&apos;ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram.&quot; So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka&apos;ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of &apos;Umar who said, &quot;If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran).&quot;"/>

When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &quot;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home.&quot; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, &quot;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?&quot;"/>

Later on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Qur&apos;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&apos;an. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &quot;We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&apos;an in public.

We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &apos;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&apos; What she said scared me and I said to her, &apos;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&apos; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &apos;Does any of you keep Allah&apos;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&apos; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &apos;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&apos;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&apos;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&apos;t ask Allah&apos;s Apostle too many things, and don&apos;t retort upon him in any case, and don&apos;t desert him.

He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&apos;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&apos; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone.

During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Allah&apos;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Allah&apos;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept."/>

He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, &apos;How is that (girl)?&apos; I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &apos;Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &apos;Let Mistah be ruined.&apos; I said, &apos;You are saying a bad word.

Don&apos;t worry much about this matter. By Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.&apos; I said, &apos;Glorified be Allah! Are the people really taking of this matter?&apos; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Allah&apos;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. &apos;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&apos; &apos;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &apos;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth.&apos; On that Allah&apos;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &apos;O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her?&apos; Buraira said, &apos;No, by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&apos; On that day Allah&apos;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing &apos;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.

While we were in this state, Allah&apos;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said, &apos;O &apos;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&apos; When Allah&apos;s Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle.&apos; I said to my mother, &apos;Talk to Allah&apos;s Apostle on my behalf.&apos; She said, &apos;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&apos;s Apostle."/>

By Allah I never thought that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur&apos;an.

The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &quot;The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;Yes, you wish.&quot; So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him. The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &quot;O people! When something happens to you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: &apos;Subhan Allah&apos;, (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?&quot; Abu Bakr replied, &quot;It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet."/>

  <verse index="890" text="When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar&apos;s hands and feet, Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, &quot;No doubt, Allah&apos;s Apostle made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and said to them, &apos;We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Allah allows you.&apos; Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them.&quot; When Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq&apos;s came and addressed &apos;Umar, &quot;O chief of the believers, will you exile us although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah&apos;s Apostle, i.e.: What will your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?&quot; The Jew replied, &quot;That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim.&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie.&quot; &apos;Umar then drove them out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddles and ropes, etc.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="891" text="(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&apos;s Apostle set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &quot;Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&quot; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&apos; (i.e. the she-camel&apos;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&apos; has become stubborn!&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Al-Qaswa&apos; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&quot; Then he said, &quot;By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="891" text="The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to Allah&apos;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&apos;i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza&apos;a and they were the advisers of Allah&apos;s Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &quot;I left Kab bin Luai and &apos;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &apos;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e. the &apos;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&quot; Budail said, &quot;I will inform them of what you have said.&quot; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, &quot;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to you if you should like.&quot; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said, &quot;Relate what you heard him saying.&quot; Budail said, &quot;I heard him saying so-and-so,&quot; relating what the Prophet had told him."/>
  <verse index="891" text="Urwa bin Mas&apos;ud got up and said, &quot;O people! Aren&apos;t you the sons? They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He added, &quot;Am I not the father?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you mistrust me?&quot; They said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Don&apos;t you know that I invited the people of &apos;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you&apos;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&quot; They said, &quot;You may meet him.&quot; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &quot;O Muhammad! Won&apos;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&quot; Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &quot;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?&quot; Urwa said, &quot;Who is that man?&quot; They said, &quot;He is Abu Bakr.&quot; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &quot;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&quot; Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&apos;s beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu&apos;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &quot;Remove your hand from the beard of Allah&apos;s Apostle.&quot; Urwa raised his head and asked, &quot;Who is that?&quot; The people said, &quot;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&apos;ba.&quot; Urwa said, &quot;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?&quot;"/>
  <verse index="891" text="Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him, &quot;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&apos;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, &quot;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&apos;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect.&quot; Urwa added, &quot;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it.&quot; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &quot;Allow me to go to him,&quot; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Allah&apos;s Ap le I said, &quot;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of him.&quot; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &quot;Glorified be Allah! It is not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; When he returned to his people, he said, &apos;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka&apos;ba.&quot; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, &quot;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&quot; Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came."/>
  <verse index="891" text="When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &quot;Now the matter has become easy.&quot; Suhail said to the Prophet &quot;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&quot; So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &quot;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;As for &apos;Beneficent,&apos; by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously.&quot; The Muslims said, &quot;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Write: By Your Name O Allah.&quot; Then he dictated, &quot;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah&apos;s Apostle has concluded.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;By Allah, if we knew that you are Allah&apos;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: &quot;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&quot; (Az-Zuhri said, &quot;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his companions perform &apos;Umra.)&quot; The Prophet said to Suhail, &quot;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&apos;ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;By Allah, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the &apos;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year.&quot; So, the Prophet got that written."/>
  <verse index="891" text="Then Suhail said, &quot;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&quot; The Muslims said, &quot;Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &apos;Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &quot;O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;The peace treaty has not been written yet.&quot; Suhail said, &quot;I will never allow you to keep him.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes, do.&quot; He said, &quot;I won&apos;t do.: Mikraz said, &quot;We allow you (to keep him).&quot; Abu Jandal said, &quot;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&apos;t you see how much I have suffered?&quot;"/>
  <verse index="891" text="Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &quot;I went to the Prophet and said, &apos;Aren&apos;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&apos; The Prophet said, &apos;Yes, indeed.&apos; I said, &apos;Isn&apos;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&apos; He said, &apos;I am Allah&apos;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&apos; I said, &apos;Didn&apos;t you tell us that we would go to the Ka&apos;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&apos;ba this year?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;So you will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; &quot; Umar further said, &quot;I went to Abu Bakr and said, &apos;O Abu Bakr! Isn&apos;t he truly Allah&apos;s Prophet?&apos; He replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; I said, &apos;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&apos; He said, &apos;Indeed, he is Allah&apos;s Apostle and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Allah, he is on the right.&apos; I said, &apos;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it?&apos; He said, &apos;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the Ka&apos;ba this year?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &quot;You will go to Ka&apos;ba and perform Tawaf around it.&quot; (Az-Zuhri said, &quot; &apos;Umar said, &apos;I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&apos; &quot;)"/>
  <verse index="891" text="When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&apos;s Apostle said to his companions, &quot;Get up and&apos; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&quot; By Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&apos;s attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, &quot;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and don&apos;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.&quot; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:--"/>

When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &quot;Abide by the promise you gave us.&quot; So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, &quot;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&quot; The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &quot;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried it many times.&quot; Abu Bair said, &quot;Let me have a look at it.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="891" text="When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running.

Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure.
