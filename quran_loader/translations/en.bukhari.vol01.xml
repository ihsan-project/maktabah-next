He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira.

Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.&quot; (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah&apos;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely.

  <verse index="6" text="Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&apos;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king.

  <verse index="6" text="I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&apos; Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allah&apos;s Apostle which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &quot;In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path.

Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &apos;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&apos; The people replied, &apos;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews)."/>

On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &apos;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&apos;"/>
  <verse index="6" text="(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed.

  <verse index="124" text="The Prophet said, &quot;Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, &quot;Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &quot;I am the most learned.&quot; Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him &quot;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.&quot; Moses said, &quot;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&quot; Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha&apos; bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: &quot;Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey.&quot; Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, &quot;Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish.&quot; Moses remarked, &quot;That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, &quot;How do people greet each other in your land?&quot; Moses said, &quot;I am Moses.&quot; He asked, &quot;The Moses of Bani Israel?&quot; Moses replied in the affirmative and added, &quot;May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: &quot;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah&apos;s knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.&quot; Al-Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, &quot;These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Call me not to account for what I forgot.&quot; The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy&apos;s head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, &quot;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none.&quot; Al-Kha,dir replied, &quot;Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?&quot; Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, &quot;If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it.&quot; Al-Khadir replied, &quot;This is the parting between you and me.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. &quot;"/>

There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &apos;Auf said that Abu Raja&apos; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &apos;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &apos;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &quot;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&quot; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &quot;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&quot; He replied, &quot;I am Junub and there is no water. &quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&quot;"/>

Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &apos;Auf added that Abu Raja&apos; had named him but he had forgotten) and &apos;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &quot;Where can we find water?&quot; She replied, &quot;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&quot; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &quot;Where?&quot; They said, &quot;To Allah&apos;s Apostle .&quot; She said, &quot;Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, the same person. So come along.&quot; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &quot;Help her to dismount.&quot; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&apos;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &quot;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&quot; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &quot;O so and so what has delayed you?&quot; She said, &quot;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi&apos; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&apos;s true Apostle.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="498" text="It is not good that you people have made us (women) equal to dogs and donkeys. No doubt I saw Allah&apos;s Apostle praying while I used to lie between him and the Qibla and when he wanted to prostrate, he pushed my legs and I withdrew them."/>
  <verse index="499" text="Narrated &apos;Amr bin Maimuin:"/>
  <verse index="499" text="&apos;Abdullah bin Mas&apos;ud said, &quot;While Allah&apos;s Apostle was praying beside the Ka&apos;ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering. One of them said, &apos;Don&apos;t you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his shoulders?&apos; The most unfortunate amongst them (&apos;Uqba bin Abi Mu&apos;ait) went (and brought them) and when Allah&apos;s Apostle prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their faces. When Allah&apos;s Apostle completed his prayer, he said, &apos;O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.&apos; He said so thrice and added, &apos;O Allah! take revenge on &apos;Amr bin Hisham, &apos;Utba bin Rabia, Shaiba bin Rabi&apos;a, Al-Walid bin&apos;Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, &apos;Uqba bin Abi Mu&apos;ait and &apos;Umar a bin Al-Walid.&quot; Abdullah added, &quot;By Allah! I saw all of them dead in the battle field on the day of Badr and they were dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well) at Badr: Allah&apos;s Apostle then said, &apos;Allah&apos;s curse has descended upon the people of the Qalib (well)."/>
