He had chopped off one of my hands and he said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?&quot; The Prophet said. &quot;Do not kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the sentence.&quot; The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, &quot;If a faithful believer conceals his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at Mecca before.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="18" text="Narrated Anas:"/>
  <verse index="18" text="A Jew killed a girl so that he may steal her ornaments. He struck her with a stone, and she was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive.

  <verse index="19" text="In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&apos;a killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah&apos;s Apostle got up saying, &quot;Allah held back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer killed.&quot; Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood up and said, &quot;Write that) for me, O Allah&apos;s Apostle!&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said (to his companions), &quot;Write that for Abu Shah.&quot; Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for graves.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Except Al-idhkkir.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="20" text="For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was not permitted as an alternate. But Allah said to this nation (Muslims): &apos;O you who believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, .....(up to) ...end of the Verse. (2.178)"/>
  <verse index="20" text="Ibn &apos;Abbas added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse, means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn &apos;Abbas added: The Verse: &apos;Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.&apos; (2.178) means that the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude."/>
  <verse index="21" text="Narrated Ibn &apos;Abbas:"/>
  <verse index="21" text="The Prophet said, &quot;The most hated persons to Allah are three: (1) A person who deviates from the right conduct, i.e., an evil doer, in the Haram (sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina); (2) a person who seeks that the traditions of the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, should remain in Islam (3) and a person who seeks to shed somebody&apos;s blood without any right.&quot;"/>

He shouted (to his companions), &quot;O Allah&apos;s worshipers, my father, my father!&quot; But by Allah, they did not stop till they killed him (i.e., Hudhaifa&apos;s father).

The Prophet said, &quot;Who is the driver (of these camels)?&quot; They said, &quot;Amir.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;May Allah bestow His Mercy on him !&quot; The people said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer!&quot; Then &apos;Amir was killed the following morning. The people said, &quot;The good deeds of &apos;Amir are lost as he has killed himself.&quot; I returned at the time while they were talking about that. I went to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Prophet! Let my father be sacrificed for you! The people claim that &apos;Amir&apos;s good deeds are lost.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever says so is a liar, for &apos;Amir will have a double reward as he exerted himself to obey Allah and fought in Allah&apos;s Cause. No other way of killing would have granted him greater reward.&quot;"/>

We went to Khaibar and found one of us murdered.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Let the older among you come forward and speak.&quot; Then the Prophet said, to them, &quot;Bring your proof against the killer.&quot; They said &quot;We have no proof.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Then they (the defendants) will take an oath.&quot; They said, &quot;We do not accept the oaths of the Jews.&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle did not like that the Blood-money of the killed one be lost without compensation, so he paid one-hundred camels out of the camels of Zakat (to the relatives of the deceased) as Diya (Blood-money)."/>
  <verse index="37" text="Narrated Abu Qilaba:"/>
  <verse index="37" text="Once &apos;Umar bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Aziz sat on his throne in the courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him. Then he admitted them and (when they came in), he said, &quot;What do you think of Al-Qasama?&quot; They said, &quot;We say that it is lawful to depend on Al-Qasama in Qisas, as the previous Muslim Caliphs carried out Qisas depending on it.&quot; Then he said to me, &quot;O Abu Qilaba! What do you say about it?&quot; He let me appear before the people and I said, &quot;O Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs. If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&quot; He replied, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, Allah&apos;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&quot; Then the people said, &quot;Didn&apos;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&apos;s Apostle cut off the hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&quot; I said, &quot;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &quot;Eight persons from the tribe of &apos;Ukl came to Allah&apos;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and complained about that to Allah&apos;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &quot;Won&apos;t you go out with the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&apos; milk and urine (as medicine)?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So they went out and drank the camels&apos; milk and urine, and after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&apos;s Apostle and took away all the camels. This news reached Allah&apos;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them in the sun till they died.&quot; I said, &quot;What can be worse than what those people did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&quot;"/>
  <verse index="37" text="Then &apos;Anbasa bin Said said, &quot;By Allah, I never heard a narration like this of today.&quot; I said, &quot;O &apos;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&quot; &apos;Anbasa said, &quot;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is among them.&quot; I added, &quot;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by Allah&apos;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to Allah&apos;s Apostle and said to him, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle, we have found our companion who had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle went out and asked them, &quot;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed him?&quot; They said, &quot;We think that the Jews have killed him.&quot; The Prophet sent for the Jews and asked them, &quot;Did you kill this (person)?&quot; They replied, &quot;No.&quot; He asked the Al-Ansars, &quot;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an oath that they have not killed him?&quot; They said, &quot;It matters little for the Jews to kill us all and then take false oaths.&quot; He said, &quot;Then would you like to receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your man)?&quot; They said, &quot;We will not take the oath.&quot; Then the Prophet himself paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&quot; The narrator added, &quot;The tribe of Hudhail repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance."/>
  <verse index="37" text="Then, at a place called Al-Batha&apos; (near Mecca), the man attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured the Yemenite and brought him to &apos;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &quot;He has killed our companion.&quot; The Yemenite said, &quot;But these people had repudiated him (i.e., their companion).&quot; &apos;Umar said, &quot;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had not repudiated him.&quot; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &quot;We and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year and then died.&quot; I further said, &quot;&apos;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in Sham.&quot;"/>

So when Allah&apos;s Apostle saw him, he said (to him), &quot;If I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your eye with this (sharp iron bar).&quot; Allah&apos;s Apostle added, &quot;The asking for permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there is in the house without the permission of its people).&quot;"/>

He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira.

He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read,&quot; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, &quot;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&quot; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &quot;Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists).

But have the glad tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&quot; Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &apos;Abdul &apos;Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&apos;s brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &quot;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.&quot; Waraqa asked, &quot;O my nephew!

If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly.&quot; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, &quot;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&apos;s Apostle in truth&quot; whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before.

He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, &apos;Who are these (two) persons?&apos; They replied, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &apos;Who is this (man)?&apos; They said to me, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &apos;Who is this?&apos; They replied, &apos;Proceed! Proceed!&apos; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &apos;Go up and I went up&apos; The Prophet added, &quot;So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.&quot; The Prophet further added, &quot;My two companions (angels) said to me, &apos;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&apos; I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &apos;That (palace) is your place.&apos; I said to them, &apos;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&apos; They replied, &apos;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to them, &apos;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&apos; They replied, &apos;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).&quot; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &quot;O Allah&apos;s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;And also the children of pagans.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;My two companions added, &apos;The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.&apos;&quot;"/>

He will then order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration.

Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest).

Abu Musa invited the man to eat but the man said, &quot;I have seen chicken eating some dirty things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken.&quot; Abu Musa said to him, &quot;Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet with a few men from Ash&apos;ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Allah, I will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.&apos; Then a few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying, &apos;Where are the group of Ash&apos;ariyyin?&apos; So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us and then we set out. We said, &apos;What have we done? Allah&apos;s Apostle took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided us with mounts. We made Allah&apos;s Apostle forget his oath! By Allah, we will never be successful.&apos; So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, &apos;I have not provided you with the mount, but Allah has done so. By Allah, I may take an oath to do something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and make the expiation for my oath.&apos; &quot;"/>

Do you know what is meant by belief in Allah? It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Allah&apos;s Cause). And I forbid you four things, (i.e., Do not drink alcoholic drinks) Ad-Dubba, An-Naqir, (pitched water skins), Az-Zuruf, Al-Muzaffat and Al--Hantam (names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).&quot; (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1)"/>
