Later on the people asked Allah&apos;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:--"/>
  <verse index="25" text="&quot;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them...&quot; (4.127)"/>
  <verse index="25" text="and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights."/>

Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said after reading t, &apos;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about Allah&apos;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been concluded between Allah&apos;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said, Caesar&apos;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar&apos;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator. &apos;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a prophet.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;I replied, &apos;I am the nearest relative to him.&apos; He asked, &apos;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;He is my cousin,&apos; and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &apos;Let him come nearer.&apos; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his translator, &apos;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his translator, &apos;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&apos; I replied, &apos;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&apos; He said, &apos;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before him? &apos;I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he claimed? &apos; I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &apos;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&apos; I replied, &apos;No.&apos; He said, &quot;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&apos; I replied, &apos;It is the poor who follow him.&apos; He said, &apos;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by day)?&apos; I replied,&apos; They are increasing.&apos; He said, &apos;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his (the Prophet&apos;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&apos;. I replied, &apos;No. &apos; He said, &apos;Does he break his promises? I replied, &apos;No, but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;Other than the last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &apos;Have you ever had a war with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;Yes.&apos; He said, &apos;What was the outcome of your battles with him?&apos; I replied, &apos;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&apos; He said, &apos;What does he order you to do?&apos; I said, &apos;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.&apos; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &apos;Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&apos; &quot; Abu Sufyan added, &quot;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&apos;s Apostle and it was read. Its contents were:--"/>

About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina.

Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and said, &apos;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&apos; By Allah, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.&quot; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &quot;It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.&quot; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &quot;Hadn&apos;t I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no exception.&quot; (He then recited the poetic verse):-- &quot;I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&apos;s Cause, For my killing is for Allah&apos;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&quot; Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&apos;at prayer (before being killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) &apos;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr.

O chief of the believers!&apos; Would I then neglect them? (No, of course).

Allah&apos;s Apostle used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Allah &apos;s Cause.

I ask you by Allah do you know this?&quot; They replies in the affirmative. &apos;Umar then said to &apos;Ali and &apos;Abbas. &quot;I ask you by Allah, do you know this?&quot; &apos;Umar added, &quot;When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, &apos;Abu Bakr said, &apos;I am the successor of Allah&apos;s Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr&apos;s successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. &apos;Ah and &apos;Abbas) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, &apos;Abbas, came to me asking for your share from your nephew&apos;s property, and this man, i.e. &apos;Ali, came to me asking for his wife&apos;s share from her father&apos;s property. I told you both that Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &apos;Our (prophets&apos;) properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).&apos; When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, &apos;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Allah&apos;s Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Allah&apos;s Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.&apos; So, both of you said (to me), &apos;Hand it over to us,&apos; and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this condition?&quot; The group aid, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then &apos;Umar faced &apos;Ali and Abbas saying, &quot;I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?&quot; They said, &quot;Yes. &quot; He said, &quot; Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf.&quot;"/>

Az-Zubair&apos;s sons said to him, &quot;Distribute our inheritance among us.&quot; He said, &quot;No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, &apos;Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.&quot; So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand.

  <verse index="584" text="When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&apos;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away. They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&apos;s mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&apos;s mother followed him, and when they reached Kada&apos;, she called him from behind, &apos;O Abraham! To whom are you leaving us?&apos; He replied, &apos;(I am leaving you) to Allah&apos;s (Care).&apos; She said, &apos;I am satisfied to be with Allah.&apos; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to herself, &apos;I&apos;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&apos; She ascended the Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &apos;i&apos;d better go and see the state of the child,&apos; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &apos;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&apos; She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), &apos;I&apos;d better go back and see the state of the child.&apos; But suddenly she heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &apos;Help us if you can offer any help.&apos; Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn &apos;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out. Ishmael&apos;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet) said, &quot;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&quot;) Ishmael&apos;s mother started drinking from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them, and they said, &apos;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&apos; They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &apos;O ishmael&apos;s mother! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)?&apos; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &apos;I want to call on my dependents I left (at Mecca).&apos; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&apos;s wife) and said, &apos;Where is Ishmael?&apos; She replied, &apos;He has gone out hunting.&apos; Abraham said (to her), &apos;When he comes, tell him to change the threshold of his gate.&apos; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael said to her, &apos;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&apos; Again Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&apos;s house and asked. &quot;Where is Ishmael?&quot; Ishmael&apos;s wife replied, &quot;He has gone out hunting,&quot; and added, &quot;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&apos; Abraham asked, &apos;What is your food and what is your drink?&apos; She replied, &apos;Our food is meat and our drink is water.&apos; He said, &apos;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&quot; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) said, &quot;Because of Abraham&apos;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&quot; Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending his arrows. He said, &quot;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for Him.&quot; Ishmael said, &quot;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&quot; Abraham said, &quot;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&quot; Ishmael said, &quot;Then I will do.&quot; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&apos;ba) while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &quot;O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&quot; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &apos;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&quot; (2.127)"/>

So, Allah said to him, &apos;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you.&apos; Moses said, &apos;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&apos; Allah said, &apos;Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&apos; Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &apos;bin Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &apos;Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&apos; Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, &apos;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?.&apos; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, &apos;That was what we were seeking after.&apos; So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, &apos;How do people greet each other in your land?&apos; Moses said, &apos;I am Moses.&apos; The man asked, &apos;Moses of Bani Israel?&apos; Moses said, &apos;Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&apos; He said, &apos;O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and which I do not know.&apos; Moses asked, &apos;May I follow you?&apos; He said, &apos;But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand?&apos; (Moses said, &apos;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.&apos;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &apos;O Moses!

  <verse index="671" text="Allah&apos;s Apostle said, &quot;Once three persons (from the previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in a cave.

Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&apos;s Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining Allah&apos;s Pleasure).&apos; So one of them said, &apos;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &apos;Go to those cows and drive them away.&apos; He said to me, &apos;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&apos; I said to him, &apos;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&apos; So he drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the rock.&apos; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &apos;O Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&apos; So the rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &apos;O Allah! You know that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&apos;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &apos;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower me but legally. &apos;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they came out (of the cave).&quot; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it is a kind of disbelief.)"/>

So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst.

Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &quot;Lift your hand.&quot; When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written there. They said, &quot;Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (&apos;Abdullah bin &apos;Umar said, &quot;I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the stones.&quot;"/>

  <verse index="839" text="The Prophet said, &quot;A horse may be kept for one of three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad in Allah&apos;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it, that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others to use it for Allah&apos;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the Muslims.&quot;"/>
